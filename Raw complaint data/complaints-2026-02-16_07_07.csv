12/16/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Paying off the loan,"I requested an assumption os next of kin/successor in interest for my father 's home after he passed. I was advised by Shellpoint / NewRez mortgage, who serviced the loan, that the only way to assume the loan was to withhold payment to trigger a loss mitigation and forebearance, after which I could begin the assumption process. I had submitted the will, and all required documents to the servicing company within XXXX  Days of my father 's passing in XXXX. I attempted the assumption process XXXX  times, each time going through every process they requested and submitting every document they requested. XXXX  times they failed to process the assumption. So, I decided to just pay the mortgage off completely. I submitted a formal payoff request XX/XX/XXXX and received it, and wired the funds quoted on that notice XX/XX/XXXX. Funds processed without issue. However, there seems to have been a miscommunication or error on their part where only $ XXXX of the quoted {$60.00} was properly applied, and their claim is that I still owe over {$8800.00} to finally pay off the loan as they just paid property Taxes, which were known to them at time of payoff. This appears to be a misallocation of the funds, as they pulled extra money designated for principal and payoff and applied it to escrow and other misc fees and interest. I would like an investigation into what is going on at NewRez/Shellpoint as there are numerous complaints from other homeowners regarding continued misallocation of funds. Further, based on my conversations with other financial advisors and institutions, the information that a loss mitigation and forebearance are necessities to assume the loan as sucessor in interest appears to be factually incorrect and solely based to keep me from being able to refinance the loan with another institution.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TX,77459,None,Consent provided,Web,12/16/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18086709

12/09/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"I work a job that is not consistent so since the start of my loan with New Rez, I make payments early. I have never had an issue. They provide a box that allows me to allocate my payment and I allocated my payments to future payment. In XXXX, everything was allocated as I asked and my next payment was due XX/XX/XXXX due to making and allocating on their form how I wanted my payments made. 

Suddenly on XX/XX/XXXX without any notice they took my payments and put them towards principal. I do not want the payments towards principal and did not allocate them that way. I intentionally pay early so I make sure my house payment is always made. 

I immediately called and was told it would be fixed, it was not, I called back and was told it would be escalated. I called today and was told you can not pay more than three months ahead. 

That would be find had I been told that and had I not received statements for month and been able to allocate these payments ahead. I am not sure how they can suddenly make a policy change and change my past allocations without notice or warning. 

I am now scared, I will not have funds to make those payments which is why I made them when I did. I did not want them applied towards principal, that does not help me in a couple months when I am out of funds. 

I have requested if they can not apply the payments as they had them in XXXX they refund me as I need the fund if not applied to future payments to make those payments. I feel they are doing this to try and have a reason to destroy my credit or foreclose on me. The reason for the early payments was to protect that in the uncertainty that I have. 

I request that A - they restore everything to what was on last months XXXX statement or B-refund me the extra amount put towards principal ( reducing that misapplied allocation ) and I will put in savings so I can make those payments. I will do that in the future since there has been this policy change. I do not think it is air to retroactively apply it to me. I did not agree to it and each time I made a payment I used the coupon and told them where it was to go. I do not know how they can change those terms. 

I do have this in escalation but the young lady told me she is not sure they will help me. I desperately need help so that I don't have issues with those payments and again, I do not understand how they can make a unilaterally decide to retroactively un-apply the payments as agreed and simply put them where they want. 

I am attaching the statement that shows things when they were allocated as we both agreed and prior to these reversals and mess made of my account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",KY,402XX,None,Consent provided,Web,12/09/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17883332

08/20/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","This complaint concerns various commercial loans that are currently being serviced by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. Shellpoint services a total of ( XXXX ) commercial loans consisting of ( XXXX ) scattered site properties that we own across various LLCs. 
There are two issues : our properties are single-family dwellings that are insured under a master insurance policy. Until XX/XX/year>, our insurance broker was XXXX, and our annual policy began on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and ended on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  the following year. XXXX was not the best at sending the policies out and I admit there were issues with Shellpoint receiving EOPs and COIs in the past. Knowing that we were changing carriers, I personally oversaw sending of certificates by our new insurance broker/producer, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) so that Shellpoint received notice on XXXX XXXX that we had changed insurance companies and XXXX  emailed them property ( EOP ) and General Liability ( COI ) certificates for every loan being serviced by Shellpoint. Naturally, Shellpoint did not process many of these certificates and mailed us individual letters for every property, so I spent months resending insurance certificates for approximately XXXX or so loans for the past 10 months. This has been extremely labor intensive and provides insight as to why I have no energy or patience left to deal with this. 

Now, we are receiving various notices that Shellpoint has put Forced Placed Insurance on many of our properties and deducted the cost from our escrow accounts. Some of these cost {$8000.00} per property. This means I know I have to send the insurance certs for the fourth or fifth time and then I have to make sure we receive the correct credit to our escrow account. We do not have the person power for this, and I do not believe it should be this difficult. Shellpoint is completely incompetent, or they are doing this on purpose because they make money on the FPI (? ). I am at my wits end and I don't know what else to do. This could be a full-time position for someone to just deal with uploading and tracking insurance certificates for commercial loan servicers. 

The second issue is that Shellpoint does not list the Borrower correctly so when the insurance certs are sent they list an LLC, but Shellpoint is showing the Guarantor. I sent them a copy of the signed loan documents to review to prove that our version of the certificates are correct. They ignore my email and supporting documents and put FPI in place.

We closed the sale of the home on XX/XX/year>. They received the check on XX/XX/year>. Today, XX/XX/year>, they emailed the title company stating that there is more money due. I talked with a representative of the company and they said there were additional letter generated after XX/XX/year>XXXX  stating the payoff amount had changed. I never received the letters! I emailed ( as there was not a phone number ) the contact who reached out to the title company. The responded to the title company that they are not customer facing but still did not provide the breakdown that was requested only the reduction of interest that I asked for. They will not communicate with me! This is unacceptable. 

First of all, they are stating there are more fees related to the foreclosure. In XXXX, I got the amount to take it out of foreclosure from the company and it was paid by the XX/XX/XXXX (? ) deadline. I am being told that the attorney fees were not paid. If they were not paid then the funds were misappropriated and this caused the entire problem. If they were paid and more fees were generated, I should be given that information. 

This company has been EXTREMELY difficult to get information from. My father passed at the end of XX/XX/year>. I began the process of getting information for his mortgage in XXXX when I had the documents stating I was the personal representative of the estate. It took 2 months to get me on as an authorized contact! This was a process I was told would take 2 weeks! This is exactly where the problems began. Had this been handled in a timely manner, it would not have gotten to the foreclosure process. 

I have been more than patient and understanding in this whole process. However, we are reaching court deadlines that I have to explain all the amounts paid. I spent over an hour and a half on the phone with someone from the company who really didn't have an answer for me when I got off the phone. He admitted there were things happening that shouldn't be but that it had. He stated he and his supervisors need time to do more research. I understand that. However, I have a deadline to pay the amount by tomorrow prior to XXXX or the amount will change. I need to have answers and I am not getting them in a timely manner. 

This is an unprofessional way of handling important information. There are too many hands in the pot and no one seems to know what is going on. I work in a call center. I understand noting the file. However, it seems that NO ONE is making notes or if they are, no one is reading them. I am beyond frustrated as a person who worked in banking. My dad was a veteran. I was the wife of a veteran for over 20 years. I have spent my life supporting our XXXX  and I have never seen such poor handling of a Veteran 's affairs by a company. I was also informed by the title company that this has happened to others in transactions they have handled. DO BETTER! 

I did not have to work to sell this property. I could have turned it back over to them and made it their problem. However, I did the responsible thing and contacted them and maintained contact with them. It is an error on their part that the original payoff letter did not reflect the amount they are saying is different. I should not have to pay for their error.

XXXX ( a ), mandates that furnishers of credit information report accurately and not in a misleading manner. Courts have ruled that even technically accurate information can be misleading in context. In XXXX XXXX XXXX Banking and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), the XXXX XXXX held that a furnisher can be held liable under the FCRA for reporting that is technically accurate but materially misleading. Further, XXXX v. Experian XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) reaffirmed that a forbearance or deferment should prevent adverse reporting if the borrower was told no payment was due. Additionally, under guidance from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act, if a borrower is in a forbearance due to hardship ( including declared disasters ), servicers should not report the account as delinquent. Although the XXXX Acts specific mandates have sunset, the regulatory precedent and consumer expectation around fairness and good faith negotiations remain. In my case, I made diligent efforts to seek clarification and guidance before the XXXX delinquency window closed. I was never advised that my loan would fall out of good standing if I waited for forbearance approvala decision influenced entirely by Shellpoints verbal and written communication. Finally, XXXX suggestion to contact departments that can not resolve the issue, or to mail letters to offices with no authority, has only prolonged the problem. The provided contact numbers and internal referrals have been ineffective in correcting this unjust situation. I respectfully request that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing remove the XX/XX/XXXX late payment from my credit history immediately due to the following : I proactively contacted Shellpoint well before the XXXX late mark. I relied in good faith on verbal and written assurances from Shellpoint that I could defer XXXX payment. The late reporting is materially misleading and harmful. Established case law and FCRA guidance support correction where reporting is technically accurate but contextually false. The property was impacted by a declared disaster, and I acted promptly and responsibly under those extraordinary circumstances.

01/23/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Paying off the loan,"To Whom It May Concern at Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, I am writing to formally document and escalate a serious and ongoing issue related to my attempt to pay off my mortgage, which has now been unreasonably obstructed for more than XXXX months due to actions and inactions by Newrez LLC, Shellpoints parent company. 

Despite repeated, good-faith efforts on my part to change the name on the property and loan to XXXX XXXX upon my husbands death and obtain accurate payoff information and complete payment in full, Newrez LLC has repeatedly failed to provide the necessary documentation and clarity required to finalize this transaction. This prolonged delay has effectively blocked my legal right to satisfy my mortgage obligation and has resulted in continued and unnecessary accrual of interest. 

I want to be clear : this situation is not the result of inaction on my part. I have been proactive, responsive, and persistent throughout this process. The breakdown has occurred entirely within Newrez/Shellpoints servicing and administrative processes. 

As a result of this delay, I have incurred : Ongoing and avoidable interest charges Attorney fees required to navigate what should have been a routine mortgage payoff Significant emotional distress I am a recent widow, and the length, opacity, and dismissive nature of this process have compounded an already difficult season of loss. While I recognize that mortgage servicing is complex, the extended obstruction I have experienced rises to the level of unreasonable and, in my view, emotionally harmful conduct. 

Accordingly, I am demanding the following : Immediate provision of a correct, final, and executable payoff statement Written confirmation of the steps required ( if any ) to complete payoff within a defined and prompt timeline A review of my account to determine reimbursement for : Attorney fees incurred as a direct result of these delays Interest charges accrued solely due to Newrez/Shellpoints failure to facilitate timely payoff I have already filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX If this matter is not resolved promptly and in good faith, I will proceed with the following actions without further notice : Filing a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) Submitting a complaint to the Michigan Attorney Generals Office I prefer to resolve this matter directly and professionally, without regulatory intervention. However, I am fully prepared to pursue all available remedies to protect my rights and recover the financial losses I have incurred. 

Please consider this letter a formal notice and escalation. I expect a substantive written response within ten ( 10 ) business days from receipt of this email.

08/28/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","This complaint concerns my XXXX  XXXX Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) that is part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, for which Specialized Loan Servicing LLC XXXX XXXX ) is the XXXX XXXX 

This complaint is not about my first mortgage, which is serviced by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. XXXX has no role in the HELOC. My monthly XXXX statements list XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) as the investor, and when I sought clarification, XXXX directed me to XXXX  as the Master Servicer for this XXXX XXXX. 

When I previously filed a CFPB complaint, instead of responding, XXXX improperly routed the complaint to XXXX, who then provided a response about my first mortgage. That was irrelevant, misleading, and avoided addressing my actual complaint. 

The issue is with a recorded assignment dated XX/XX/XXXX, in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This assignment is fatally flawed : XXXX. XXXX XXXX  records show XXXX as investor as early as XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX, which directly conflicts with the XXXX assignment. 
XXXX. Former XXXX Real Time Resolutions ( XXXX ) admitted in prior CFPB complaints that the creditor during their servicing period was XXXX XXXX, not Residential Trust XXXX. 
XXXX. XXXX  has stated that XXXX itself requested the XXXX assignment, even though XXXX was no longer servicing the loan at that time. This raises concerns that the document was manufactured after-the-fact. 
XXXX. Despite access to XXXX  records, public filings, and XXXX admissions, XXXX  has not corrected or explained this discrepancy. 

This clouds the chain of title, misleads courts and title examiners, and raises concerns about whether XXXX is maintaining accurate records as required under federal law. 



What I Am Requesting : XXXX. Require XXXX  to directly respond to this complaint and confirm whether the XXXX assignment is erroneous. 
XXXX. Require XXXX  to provide all documentation, servicing notes, and investor history for my HELOC from origination through present. 
XXXX. Direct XXXX  to correct the public record if the XXXX assignment was in error, ensuring XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX reflect the actual trust ( XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
XXXX. Investigate whether XXXX  has violated Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ) by failing to maintain accurate records and by improperly deflecting my complaint to XXXX. 
XXXX. Ensure the CFPB records reflect that my complaint was about the HELOC and that XXXX prior response was non-responsive. 



Why This Matters : The XXXX assignment is being used as the basis for foreclosure on my property, despite evidence it does not represent the true trust or creditor. By refusing to address the issue and instead shifting the CFPB complaint to XXXX, XXXX has failed its duty as XXXX XXXX and denied me a fair review of my complaint. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB require Specialized Loan Servicing LLC to directly address the HELOC and the XXXX assignment, rather than allowing them to sidestep the issue by involving Shellpoint.

11/13/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint/NewRez LLC ) for ongoing bad faith servicing practices, including repeated RESPA violations XXXX unauthorized fee overcharges, dual tracking during loss mitigation negotiations, mishandling of post-bankruptcy obligations, and refusal to engage in good-faith loan modification discussions. These actions have caused me significant financial harm, including escalating arrears and the threat of wrongful foreclosure on my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. This is not an isolated incidentShellpoint has a well-documented pattern of similar misconduct, as evidenced by hundreds of CFPB complaints, low consumer ratings ( e.g., XXXX on XXXX from over XXXX reviews ), and ongoing class action lawsuits for fee overcharges and misleading statements. For instance, Shellpoint topped CFPB complaint volumes in multiple months, with borrowers reporting identical issues like improper inspection fees, suspense account abuses, and dual tracking. In XXXX alone, complaints on XXXX and XXXX  detail Shellpoint 's bad faith in holding insurance proceeds, delaying modifications, and adding junk fees post-disaster or bankruptcy. A XXXX class action settlement for {$500000.00} addressed misleading statements to forbearance borrowers, and recent XXXX suits ( e.g., XXXX v. NewRez ) allege systematic overcharges. My case fits this pattern, amplifying the need for CFPB enforcement. 
My mortgage ( principal {>= $1,000,000} at 3.75 % interest, maturity XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) was transferred to Shellpoint after my XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy discharge in the Central District of XXXX. Despite the discharge of personal liability, Shellpoint continues sending statements demanding full acceleration ( {>= $1,000,000} as of XX/XX/XXXX ) and has ignored my repeated attempts to resolve via qualified written requests ( QWRs ) and loss mitigation. 
Key violations and timeline : Ignored QWRs ( RESPA Violations ) : Since XXXX, I have sent over XXXX certified QWRs requesting account corrections, fee itemizations, and loss mitigation options. Shellpoint has failed to acknowledge or respond substantively within the required XXXX business days under RESPA ( 12 CFR 1024.36 ), instead escalating fees and advancing foreclosure. For example, a QWR sent in XX/XX/XXXX regarding name mismatches ( e.g., "" XXXX '' vs. "" XXXX '' in notices ) and dual tracking went unanswered, mirroring complaints where Shellpoint stonewalls borrowers to force defaults. 
Unauthorized Fee Overcharges and Suspense Account Abuse : The attached XX/XX/XXXX, statement shows escalating junk fees, including {$5600.00} in legal fees ( {$690.00} attorney + {$4900.00} foreclosure costs ), {$1100.00} in other fees ( {$140.00} BPO/appraisal, {$270.00} inspection, {$310.00} recording, {$450.00} certified mail ), and a - {$31000.00} escrow deficit. New disbursements ( e.g., {$1800.00} + {$150.00} foreclosure costs and {$230.00} mail on XX/XX/XXXX ) were added without justification, despite my bankruptcy and ongoing negotiations. Shellpoint holds {$3700.00} in unapplied funds, refusing to credit them to principal, which inflates my reinstatement amount ( {$210000.00} ). These practices violate FDCPA 1692f ( prohibiting unfair collection ) and RESPA 2605 ( g ) ( escrow mishandling ), and echo class actions like the Maryland XXXX certification for improper inspection fees. Borrowers report Shellpoint padding fees during hardships, costing thousands unnecessarily. 
Dual Tracking and Bad Faith Negotiations ( HBOR Violations ) : While my attorney negotiates a loan modification ( target : $ XXXX payments with arrears deferred interest-free to maturity, XXXX % rate, XXXX term ), Shellpoint advances foreclosure with a XX/XX/XXXX, sale datedespite my equity ( ~ $ XXXX property value ) and documented hardship. This violates XXXXXXXX XXXX Homeowner BilXXXX of Rights ( HBOR, Civil Code 2923.55 ) prohibiting dual tracking during mod reviews. Their attorney, XXXX XXXX, has rejected reasonable proposals outright, contradicting Shellpoint 's own statement encouraging counseling/assistance. This bad faith is systemic : XXXX threads from XXXX call out Shellpoint for "" stealing homes '' via delays and contradictions in mod processes. My ongoing lawsuit ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) alleges wrongful foreclosure, with a rejected demurrer highlighting their procedural errors.

Post-Bankruptcy Mishandling : The statement acknowledges my bankruptcy but demands full payment, ignoring discharge protections under 11 U.S.C. 524. Shellpoint 's actions risk violating the automatic stay and discharge injunction, as seen in complaints where they harass discharged borrowers. 
Prior CFPB Involvement : My previous complaint ( CFPB # XXXX ) yielded no resolution, with Shellpoint continuing the same abuses. This escalation shows their disregard for regulatory oversight. 

These practices have caused me stress, potential credit damage, and unnecessary costs ( e.g., attorney fees ). Shellpoint 's low ratings ( XXXX on XXXX, XXXX on XXXX ) and frequent XXXXCFPB filings confirm this is deliberate bad faith to profit from defaults",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,11/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17226815

I am filing this complaint because Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( NewrezLLC ) has repeatedly failed to act in good faith and appears to be violating both federal servicing obligations and California disasterrelief laws ( XXXX XXXX ). 

Details of Violations and Concerns : XXXX. Improper Handling of Forbearance XXXX Shellpoint has only offered me a threemonth forbearance, despite XXXX requiring up to XXXX of temporary relief for disasteraffected borrowers. 
Their written communication also stated I would be responsible for a full lumpsum payment at the end of the forbearance period. 
This requirement defeats the intent of XXXX, which explicitly forbids demanding a lumpsum repayment after a disasterrelated forbearance. 
I have made it clear I am not seeking a loan modificationonly the temporary forbearance protection the law providesbut Shellpoint continues to misrepresent the terms and limit access. 

XXXX. Mishandling of XXXX XXXX XXXX Shellpoint is holding over $ XXXX in insurance funds in escrow from my homeowners claim but has not confirmed they will pay the legally required 2 % annual interest under XXXX. 
They have also made it unreasonably difficult to access these funds for my home rebuild, demanding excessive documentation and slow responses to every request. 
Their own representatives have directed me in circlesbetween customer service and loss draft departmentswith no one able to provide a written answer. 

XXXX. Failure to Provide Timely or Clear Communication It has taken months of repeated calls, emails, and escalations just to get partial information. Including me directly messaging the CEO of the holding company that owns the mortgage servicer. 
Shellpoint representatives rarely provide written responses, offer vague or conflicting explanations, and often fail to follow through on promised updates. 
This lack of transparency has caused significant stress and delay in my recovery, at a time when I am already displaced and trying to rebuild my home.

I am a Supervisory Consumer Safety Inspector for the United States Department of Agriculture , Food Safety Inspection Services. I have worked for USDA for over 18 years and now the government has been shut down since XX/XX/XXXX. So, what that means for myself is that I am going to my duty station at a non-payment status.

12/01/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Details of the Problem I am filing a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX and Newrez LLC ( dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, successor to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) for failing to inform me of mandatory CARES Act forbearance options, manufacturing fraudulent documentation, engaging in bad-faith servicing, illegally accelerating my loan during a federal foreclosure moratorium, and engaging in the prohibited practice of dual tracking. 
Background My mortgage loan with XXXX XXXX is federally backed by XXXX XXXX, making it subject to CARES Act protections and the federal foreclosure moratorium active until XX/XX/XXXX. Due to severe financial hardship from the COVID-19 pandemic, my loan went into default. When the loan was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX while in default, they became "" debt collectors '' under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). Newrez LLC ( XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) is the successor to XXXX following an acquisition. 
Chronology of Events & Timeline Issues XXXX XXXX Failures ( Late XXXX XXXX ) : Inaccessible Home Preservation Specialist : My assigned specialist, XXXX XXXX XXXX was consistently inaccessible and failed to provide guidance on appropriate workout options ( Payment Deferral, Flex Modification, etc. ), which is a violation of servicer duties. The inability to contact not one, but two, XXXX XXXX home preservation specialists, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is a significant issue and a severe failure to perform their duties. The very assignment of these specialists proves that I had previously reached out to the bank and formally requested assistance. 
Imposition of Unauthorized Fees : Home preservation fees were being charged to me during a time in which I was actively working with XXXX XXXX on a loan modification. This is a potential violation of servicer regulations that prohibit charging certain fees while a loss mitigation application is under review or a forbearance is active. 
Failure to Disclose CARES Act Options : Throughout my interactions, I was never informed that the immediate, mandatory CARES Act forbearance was a viable option, despite my documented hardship. The COVID-19 specific guidance under Regulation X of RESPA required servicers to inform borrowers about CARES Act forbearance options during live contact, a requirement XXXX XXXX failed to meet. 
Unviable Loan Modification Offer & Misinformation : The "" Flex Trial Payment '' offer was discovered later in general paperwork, as I was never verbally notified about it. XXXX XXXX proceeded with this offer without proper underwriting or collecting current financial documentation reflecting my pandemic hardship. This offer did not align with XXXX XXXX COVID-19 Flex Modification guidelines designed to ensure sustainable payment reductions. 
Executive Office Misrepresentation : An executive case specialist, XXXX XXXX, provided explicitly inaccurate information, stating the trial payment was only "" designed to bring the account current '' and not necessarily lower my payment. This misrepresentation highlights systemic failure or intentional misinformation. 
XXXX XXXX 's Written Admission ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : In their formal response letter, XXXX XXXX explicitly admitted : "" We are unable to locate documentation from you requesting payment assistance or application. '' This is a critical admission : it confirms my requests for assistance were lost, ignored, or never logged into their system. It invalidates their prior claim that they removed me from assistance for "" not responding. '' The combination of missed communication, misinformation, and lost documentation suggests a systemic problem rather than an isolated oversight. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Newrez LLC/Shellpoint Servicing Violations ( Post-Transfer and During Moratorium ) : Failure to Provide Debt Validation Notice : Following the loan transfer to SLS and initial communication, I was never provided a written validation of debt notice within the required five days, a clear violation of the FDCPA. 
Fraudulent Breach Letter and Forgery : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX generated a fraudulent breach letter associated with an invalid tracking number and an alleged forged signature on the certified mailing receipt. This letter was supposedly sent out during the federal mortgage foreclosure moratorium ( which was active until XX/XX/XXXX ). The servicer 's actions constitute an unlawful acceleration of my loan, as proper written notification was never validly delivered as required by law and the loan agreement, and was prohibited during that timeframe. 
Violation of Foreclosure Moratorium : The issuance of this breach letter and the acceleration occurred during the federal mortgage foreclosure moratorium ( which applied to federally backed loans like mine ), a clear violation of protections. 
Contradictory Reinstatement Quotes and Hidden Fees : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX provided a reinstatement quote in which it was explicitly noted with a "" {$0.00} '' entry, indicating that no legal fees, property preservation fees, late fees, or any other charges would be added. However, these exact fees are clearly shown in my payment history. Furthermore, Shellpoint later provided me with a separate, detailed breakdown of property preservation fees dating from XXXX until XXXX. This discrepancy demonstrates deceptive practices and the imposition of unauthorized fees. 
Dual Tracking : I believe I may have also been a victim of dual tracking, a practice prohibited under CFPB Regulation X of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). Mortgage servicers are generally prohibited from proceeding with foreclosure while a loss mitigation application is pending review. This violation is further underscored by the improper assessment of home preservation charges while I was actively seeking assistance, which suggests the servicer was simultaneously working toward foreclosure and loss mitigation tracks. 
Relevant Federal Law Violations The actions described above violate specific federal laws and regulations, suggesting systemic failures : CARES Act ( Section 4022 ) : The servicer violated the mandate to grant forbearance upon request ( Failure to Grant Forbearance Upon Request ). They imposed fees and interest beyond what was permitted ( Imposing Unauthorized Fees and Penalties ). The issuance of a breach letter during the moratorium violated Section 4022 ( c ) ( 2 ) ( Violation of the Foreclosure Moratorium ). There was also potential Inaccurate Credit Reporting.

Regulation X of RESPA ( 12 CFR Part 1024 ) : The servicer engaged in prohibited Dual Tracking ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ) by accelerating the loan during a time when loss mitigation options should have been explored and by assessing home preservation charges during that period. The inability to contact home preservation specialists is a Failure to Exercise Reasonable Diligence ( 12 CFR 1024.39 ), a duty that includes informing borrowers of COVID-19 options during required live contact. The general handling of my case suggests a Failure to Provide a Timely Response to loss mitigation inquiries.

Violations of the CFPA : The "" explicitly inaccurate information, '' "" manufactured fraudulent documentation, '' and contradictory reinstatement quotes are examples of the Misrepresentation and Deception that constitutes an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice ( UDAAPs ) under the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

They forced placed insurance on us.

10/16/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Unethical financial business practice by Newrez Mortgage Co likely preventing consumers from recasting mortgage. I have a right to recast my mortgage and have a significant lump-sum to put down which will greatly reduce the amount of interest I'm paying ; of course, it is not in the best interest of Newrez to lose interest. Therefore, there is no reason for them to train their employees on the process of recast. 
There is no way anyone should be expected to feel comfortable paying $ XXXX online/over the phone to Principal with no paperwork or written documentation memorializing a re-cast v. lump-sum principal payment. According to XXXX agents at Newrez I'm just supposed to "" trust '' that they apply my lump-sum to a re-cast agreement v. straight principal payment, and Newrez can't give me anything in writing to memorialize this. Another agent who processed my case said absolutely do not pay into Principal without the paperwork processed first. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Called Mortgage Co [ Newrez ] to obtain process for Mortgage re-cast. Agent informed me that the process for re-cast is for to pay the lump-sum, plus a {$250.00} fee, to the Principal option online ; based on the notes he makes in the system they'd use the payment to recast my mortgage. I advised the agent I'm uncomfortable paying close to $ XXXX to principal and relying on the notes he made to ensure this becomes a re-cast and isn't simply applied as a lump-sum principal payment ; there should certainly be some sort of paperwork on the matter or someone to talk to about what my new payment would look like, etc. I was informed by the agent that isn't the way it works ; he said if I don't like the way it turns out Newrez will send me a refund check. I questioned him on that too - why would you send a refund check for $ XXXX when I owe you $ XXXX? He said I was being overly suspicious and Newrez is my mortgage co they are not trying to rip me off. He practically talked over me the entire time and when I tried to speak ( I wasn't even raising my voice ) he told me to count to ten. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Called XXXX XXXX in an attempt to get a different agent. This agent, who was very professional, said process is for her to open a case, in which paperwork will be sent to me within 9 days ( has to go through an approval process ), after receipt of the paperwork follow the direction to make the payment for the re-cast. XXXX said based on the date case is opened ( and provided case # ) the re-cast can be complete before XXXX payment is due. Agent said DO NOT MAKE A PRINCIPAL PAYMENT without the processed paperwork ; she said this is incorrect, apologized for someone providing incorrect info and would report it to her supervisor. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Called XXXX XXXX as no paperwork has been received and online account doesn't have any indicators that there is a re-cast case opened. This agent, who didn't even take the case # I offered up, says the process requires you make a lump-sum payment including fee to the Principal option of your account then the re-cast will take place, and no paperwork will be sent until you make that payment. I advised agent that I'm not sending $ XXXX blindly to Principal without written documentation & another agent already advised me not to do that, it is not the process. He responded that the process has recently changed. I questioned him as to when exactly the processed changed because I opened the case 10 days ago and that is not what I was told. I advised agent I needed to talk to a supervisor and he said, if time is of the essence for your XXXX payment you're wasting your time, the supervisor will tell you the same thing. I also brought to his attention if the process changed between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX was anyone going to contact me to let me know I wasn't getting paperwork because the process changed ; this is very suspicious. XXXX told me that a supervisor would call me back within XXXX. I advised him I'd be filing a complaint as this is very unethical and Newrez profits from not processing my re-cast. I should also note, that this agent, same as the first, talked over me the entire time ; I had to tell him to stop talking as it was my turn to speak.

01/25/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Closing disclosure or other related disclosures,"A first-lien mortgage and a home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) secured by the same property were serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and later by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing , a division of NewRez LLC XXXX The first-lien mortgage XXXX owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX A non-judicial foreclosure sale occurred on XX/XX/year>. 

Following foreclosure, I requested loan history and account disclosures. The servicer produced a Loan History Summary and Loan History Statement for the first-lien mortgage that were presented as consumer loan history disclosures. 

Those records reflect a reported principal balance of approximately {$0.00} at or near the time foreclosure activity occurred, while simultaneously reflecting litigation-related disbursements and foreclosure-associated servicing entries. The disclosures do not explain how foreclosure was conducted, authorized, or reconciled in the presence of a de minimis reported principal balance, nor do they explain how foreclosure disposition activity affected the reported loan state. 

Separately, HELOC statements issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the same collateral reflect extraordinary Outstanding Late Charges/ Fees totaling approximately {$270000.00}, posted immediately before and after the foreclosure event. These amounts include multiple six-figure entries dated XX/XX/year>, labeled as fees and not identified as payoff, recovery, disposition, or collateral-related accounting adjustments. 

The timing and magnitude of these HELOC fee entries coincide with the foreclosure of the senior lien but are reflected solely as servicing-level fees, without explanation of how they relate to the foreclosure sale, collateral disposition, or application of proceeds across lien positions XXXX 

Across both accounts, the disclosures provided to me as a consumer present : Near-zero or nominal principal balances contemporaneous with foreclosure activity ; Large foreclosure-related amounts characterized as servicing fees rather than clearly identified disposition or recovery entries ; and No clear reconciliation showing how foreclosure activity, fees, and reported balances align. 

I requested clarification and reconciliation from the servicer. While documents were produced, they did not explain how the balances and charges were calculated or classified in a manner that would allow a consumer to understand or independently verify the accuracy of the disclosures. 

As provided, the records functioned as consumer disclosures, yet they do not clearly communicate loan status, payoff condition, fee basis, or the effect of foreclosure on either account. This creates uncertainty regarding whether the disclosures accurately reflect account state and whether fees were characterized in a manner that is clear, transparent, and not misleading. 

Additionally, the servicer-provided loan history records reflect litigation-related disbursements and foreclosure-associated entries attributed to a law firm that does not appear to be the firm that conducted the foreclosure sale. The foreclosure was carried out by a different law firm than the one identified in the servicing records, and the disclosures provided do not explain this discrepancy or clarify the role of each firm. As presented, the records do not clearly or accurately identify the entities responsible for foreclosure activity associated with the account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TX,78132,None,Consent provided,Web,01/25/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18989935

Newrez later claimed that payoff was insufficient due to an escrow shortage created by Newrez own tax disbursement made on XXXX XXXX, the same day they received the payoff wire. This escrow activity was entirely outside of my control. Despite this, Newrez did not promptly notify me or my closing agent, did not apply partial funds, did not return the funds immediately, did not act to prevent avoidable financial harm. Newrez admitted in writing that they retained the payoff funds for 11 days before returning them, yet claims no servicing error occurred and refused to return interest or late charges. I believe this conduct constitute unreasonable mortgage servicing, a failure to timely handle payoff funds, and a failure to prevent avoidable fees and interest, in violation of federal servicing standards.

10/06/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Shellpoint Mortgage has been holding my payments in unapplied funds, overcharging thousands in interest, and reporting a false loan balance to credit bureaus. I am current and a month ahead, yet my balance keeps rising instead of going down. Their accounting is deceptive, abusive, and financially damaging. 

Between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I have repeatedly made full and timely payments on my mortgage, yet Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing has consistently mishandled my account, misapplied payments, inflated interest, and falsely reported my balance to the credit bureaus. 

XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX originated for XXXX at XXXX XXXX 

XX/XX/XXXX : I made my first payment of {$3600.00} early ( before the XX/XX/XXXX due date ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I made my second payment of {$3600.00}, placing me one month ahead. 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : I began making semi-monthly payments of {$1800.00} twice a month. By mid-XXXX, I had paid a total of XXXX, equal to four full monthly payments when only three were due. 

Despite this, Shellpoint placed my funds into unapplied payments instead of crediting them when received. They repeatedly reversed and re-applied identical transactions, charged excessive interest as though my payments were late, and failed to reduce my principal balance properly. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoints own records show : - Only XXXX} applied to principal - {XXXX  to interest, and - A reported balance of XXXX} If payments had been credited correctly, my balance should be approximately XXXX meaning Shellpoint has overstated my balance by about XXXX and overcharged XXXX XXXX in interest. 

I contacted Shellpoint multiple times : - XX/XX/XXXX : Emailed through their website explaining the payment errors. 

- XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke with XXXX XXXX Customer Service ), who opened a complaint and promised a XXXX callback from XXXX Services XXXX 

- XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke with XXXX XXXX Customer Service ), who admitted payments were being held unapplied until the full amount is received, even though I was a month ahead. He opened complaint # XXXX, said my automatic payments would be stopped until corrected, and again promised a callback within XXXX hours, which I never received. 

Shellpoint has still not corrected my account. They continue to misapply payments and are reporting the inflated balance to credit bureaus, damaging my credit. 

This conduct violates RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ), TILA/Regulation Z ( 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ), FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ), and UDAAP prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts.

XXXX. Proper reallocation of all payments as of the date received.

3. Reversal of improper interest charges.

4. Correction of false credit reporting to XXXX XXXX and XXXX.

10/23/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this urgent complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) for egregious violations of federal and XXXX  laws, including RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Despite my exhaustive legal effortsmultiple Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ), a pending lawsuit ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), and a loan modification application submitted by my authorized representatives, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX persists in deflecting, providing evasive responses, and pushing an illegal foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, just days away. I demand immediate CFPB intervention to halt this sale, enforce compliance, and hold Shellpoint accountable for their systemic misconduct. 

Pattern of Violations and Deflection Unanswered QWRs ( RESPA Violations ) : I sent multiple QWRs in recent months ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX and others, with certified mail receipts available ) requesting the chain of title, Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ) for the XXXX XXXX Trust, payment history, and corrections for servicing errors ( e.g., inflated {$180000.00} arrears, unapplied payments, and incorrect interest rate hikes from my original 2 % rate ). Shellpoint has failed to acknowledge within 5 business days or respond substantively within 30 business days, as required by 12 C.F.R. 1024.36. Instead, Ive received vague, boilerplate replies ( e.g., 1316 identical responses since XX/XX/XXXX ) or no response at all, exposing Shellpoint to statutory damages of up to {$2000.00} per violation, plus actual damages and attorney fees. 

Supervisors Refusal to Engage ( XXXX  Violation ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, a Shellpoint supervisor refused to discuss my loan or confirm receipt of my loan modification package, deflecting to their attorney, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). This violates XXXX XXXX, which mandates a responsive XXXX. Previous XXXX  ( e.g., XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) have been equally unhelpful, with XXXX admitting to incorrect guidance on a prior notice of default, requiring coaching and corrective feedback ( XX/XX/XXXX ). This pattern of deflection leaves me powerless and facing an imminent foreclosure. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Violation ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX a complete loan modification package on my behalf on XX/XX/XXXX, yet Shellpoint has not confirmed receipt or paused the foreclosure sale set for XX/XX/XXXX. This constitutes illegal dual-tracking under XXXX XXXX XXXX as Shellpoint continues foreclosure proceedings despite an active loss mitigation review. Their quick denial of a prior application ( XX/XX/XXXX ) without appeal rights further violates XXXX and RESPA, especially given new hardships and documented servicing errors. 

Loan Ownership Disputes ( FDCPA and Standing Issues ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) provided a written statement denying ownership of my loan and directed me to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  as master servicer, but XXXX confirmed they have had no involvement since XXXX. This contradicts Shellpoints claim of authority to foreclose, particularly given a late XXXX assignment to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which likely violates the XXXX XXXX closing window. Under XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ), an invalid assignment nullifies foreclosure standing. Shellpoints refusal to provide the original note, endorsements, or valid assignment violates FDCPA 1692g and undermines their legal authority, risking an illegal foreclosure. 

Deceptive Practices and Coercive Tactics ( UDAAP Violations ) : Shellpoints history of misleading statements ( e.g., conflicting foreclosure postponement claims from representatives like XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ), unapplied funds, and attempts to collect potentially XXXX debt ( XXXX XXXX ) violate the CFPBs Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices ( UDAAP ) rules and 11 U.S.C. 524. Their boilerplate responses to my unique CFPB complaints ( # XXXX, if active ) and failure to provide requested documents obstruct my ability to defend my home.

These issues include a potentially invalid loan transfer that breaks the chain of title, an unauthorized interest rate increase, non-responsiveness from my assigned Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ), and an improper non-judicial foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. I believe these violations contravene the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), Regulation X ( including 12 CFR 1024.40 ), and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR, including Civil Code 2924.11 ). Given the imminent foreclosure datejust weeks awayI urgently request CFPB intervention to prevent irreversible harm, such as the loss of my home. 
My loan originated on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) for {>= $1,000,000}. It was modified effective XX/XX/XXXX, via a Modification Agreement recorded in XXXX XXXX, California ( Instrument No. XXXX ). This modification was intended to be securitized into a trust in XXXX. However, I recently discovered the loan was not transferred into the trust until XXXX years later and likely well beyond the XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) cutoff date. This delay may render the assignment void under New York trust law ( which commonly governs these XXXX ), thereby breaking the chain of title and calling into question Shellpoint 's standing to service or foreclose on the loan. California courts have consistently upheld borrowers ' rights to challenge such void assignments, as established in landmark cases like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
The loan was modified by XXXX XXXX XXXX with a 2 % interest rate to stabilize my payments and prevent delinquency. Without my consent, proper notice, or any justification, Shellpoint, as the current servicer, unilaterally raised the rate to 3.5 %, leading to higher monthly payments, accumulated arrears, and potential overcharges. This increase may be entirely invalid due to the flawed XXXX transfer, which could void Shellpoint 's authority to make any changes, and it appears to breach the original modification agreement. Shellpoint has a documented history of mishandling loan modifications and rate adjustments, as evidenced by numerous CFPB complaints and a XXXX CFPB settlement requiring {$3.00} million in principal reductions for similar issues involving improper rate adjustments and servicing errors. The unauthorized rate hike has exacerbated my financial hardship, inflated my arrears, and resulted in overpayments for which I am owed a full refund, including interest on those amounts. 
Additionally, Shellpoint assigned me XXXX XXXX as a XXXX under XXXX and Regulation X to facilitate discussions on loss mitigation options. However, XXXX XXXX has been consistently non-responsive and hostile in prior interactions, as evidenced by the attached email chain from XX/XX/XXXX, where she repeatedly directed me to submit disputes in writing without addressing my concerns and stated that the loan was not assigned to a XXXXCcontradicting Shellpoint 's obligations. On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX XXXX  I emailed XXXX XXXX requesting immediate assistance with the pending foreclosure sale. I also emailed the Loss Mitigation Department to confirm her status as my XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have received no response whatsoever from either, in clear violation of requirements for an accessible, knowledgeable, and responsive XXXX This non-responsiveness and apparent hostility have severely hindered my ability to explore viable alternatives to foreclosure, such as a new loan modification, forbearance, or repayment plan, and demonstrate a pattern of poor service that makes continued assignment to XXXX XXXX untenable. 
Despite these unresolved servicing errors and my ongoing attempts to engage in loss mitigation, Shellpoint has proceeded with scheduling a non-judicial foreclosure sale for XX/XX/XXXX. This action is wrongful and premature given the chain-of-title defects, interest rate errors, lack of XXXX communication, and potential invalidity of XXXX servicing actions. Under XXXX, the sale must be postponed if a complete loss mitigation application is under review or if servicing errors remain unaddressed. Furthermore, on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Notice of Error/Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) via certified mail, demanding corrections, documentation, and a response within the statutorily required timelinesyet I have received no acknowledgment or substantive reply. Shellpoint 's records currently indicate that to bring my loan current, I would need to pay approximately {$180000.00} in arrears, an amount that is artificially inflated by the unauthorized rate increase, related fees, and unapplied payments stemming from these errors. 
These cumulative violations have caused significant stress, emotional distress, potential overpayments, credit harm, lost equity and opportunity costs, and the imminent threat of losing my home. Shellpoint 's practices align with widespread consumer complaints about deceptive foreclosures, rate mishandling, poor customer service, and systemic failures in complying with federal and state regulations.

She fell behind on her mortgage payments because she was scammed by a company claiming to help lower payments. That company is currently being tried by the United States Department of Justice. I provided information to the mortgage company and they made me Successor in Interest. However, they did not offer me a fair option to take over the mortgage. I explained to them that I could continue with the mortgage payments which were {$810.00} per month. I just needed the past due payments pushed back to the end of the loan ultimately pushing back the payout date but they offered me a plan that raised the monthly payments by {$400.00} making the payment $ XXXX a month. I agreed to it even though I knew it would be tight financially. I know Shellpoint offers forbearance and deferred payments to their borrowers. However, they did not offer those options to me knowing that my mom passed away. Of course, I agreed to the option to save my moms home. However, my first payment was returned because of an unexpected payment that came through. If the mortgage was the original amount of {$810.00}, it wouldve gone through successfully. Originally, XXXX XXXX was working on my moms loan and he was very fast with responding to emails and helping me get Successor in Interest but as soon as I was approved, my moms case was transferred to another person named XXXX who never contacted and hasnt responded to my email. I had to call to see why I couldnt make a payment online and was told that because of the returned payment of $ XXXX the loan is in pre-foreclosure and that I need to pay {$7000.00} to save the home. This is utterly disgusting for Shellpoint to do because yes I understand they are a business but why not work with me with what Im able to do to keep the loan going? Raising the monthly payments {$400.00} and demanding {$7000.00} to avoid foreclosure when all I asked was for them to push the late payments to the backend of the loan which would allow me to make the monthly payments of {$810.00}. I am not responsible for the reasons my mom fell behind on her loan but Im trying to continue doing business with Shellpoint but theyre so greedy and lack empathy for someone who is trying to make things right. Shellpoint has me to the point where I am literally begging them to stop the foreclosure and give me a chance by pushing the past payments to the backend or raise the payment to {$900.00} if they need to but to raise it up {$400.00} is pure madness.

The area I live in is rural and poor and the property is very run down so Shellpoint would lose more money by foreclosing on the loan than by working with me on what Im able to do. No one is moving to this area. Its a high poverty area with very few residents who can actually afford the mortgage. I am employed and can afford the {$810.00} payments.

01/03/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I am submitting this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against Shellpoint Mortgage Company regarding a pattern of mortgage servicing errors that have caused inaccurate escrow calculations, unjustified increases in my monthly mortgage payment, and ongoing financial harm. 

Loan Information - Servicer : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing - Property Type : Three-story duplex property ( not a condominium ) - Loan Status : Current, payments made in good faith - Issue Type : Escrow mismanagement, insurance misapplication, servicing errors, improper appraisal reliance Summary of the Problem Shellpoint has XXXX mishandled my loan through compounded servicing errors, including escrow miscalculations, failure to properly adjust insurance disbursements, reliance on a materially inaccurate appraisal, and obstruction of loss-mitigation review. These errors have resulted in artificial escrow shortages and escalating mortgage payments that do not reflect my actual obligations. 


Detailed Timeline of Issues XXXX. Loan Modification / Hardship Review Failure ( XX/XX/XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a loan modification due to financial hardship. Shellpoint repeatedly claimed my documentation had not been received, despite the documents being notarized and sent via express mail. 

- Documents were never uploaded to the portal - I was denied a trial payment option of approximately {$1200.00} per month - I was told that if my loan-to-value ratio met a stated threshold, I would automatically qualify by XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX. Materially Incorrect Appraisal Shellpoint relied on an appraisal that misclassified my three-story duplex property as a single-level condominium, reducing the stated value by approximately {$300000.00}. This inaccurate appraisal eliminated equity that Shellpoint had previously stated was key to qualification for relief. 

XXXX. Insurance Change and Escrow Misapplication ( XX/XX/XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I changed homeowners insurance to a less expensive policy. I was informed that escrow disbursements would be adjusted accordingly. 

Instead, Shellpoint : - Paid the full annual premium without proper escrow recalibration - Failed to clearly credit or account for my prior insurance refund- Did not timely or accurately adjust escrow assumptions XXXX. Escrow Analysis and Payment Shock ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Shellpoint conducted an escrow analysis that stacked : - repayment of a disputed escrow shortage, - increased future escrow contributions, and - an escrow cushion This resulted in a sudden and excessive payment increase that does not accurately reflect my insurance costs or escrow balance. 

Why This Is a Servicing Error These issues reflect : - failure to properly credit payments and refunds, - inaccurate escrow accounting, - reliance on a materially defective appraisal, and - failure to conduct loss-mitigation review in good faith. 
The resulting payment increases are the product of servicer error, not borrower nonpayment or default. 

Resolution Requested I am requesting that Shellpoint be required to : XXXX. Provide a full escrow transaction history ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. Provide the escrow analysis worksheet and assumptions used XXXX. Correctly account for insurance changes and any refunded premiums XXXX. Issue a corrected escrow analysis based on accurate figures XXXX. Adjust my monthly payment accordingly XXXX. Cease using the materially incorrect appraisal for any servicing decisions Good Faith Statement I have continued to make payments in good faith.

11/26/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am filing this complaint regarding significant servicing errors, unexplained reversals, and unusual payment handling practices by my mortgage servicer. These issues have resulted in an inflated principal balance, inconsistent payment application, and confusing account activity that I have been unable to resolve directly with the servicer. 

Summary of Issues 1. Principal balance is incorrect by approximately {$1200.00} Based on the servicers own transaction history : My principal balance on XX/XX/XXXX when the loan was transferred was {$130000.00}. 

All principal-impacting payments since that date total {$3900.00}. 

The expected principal balance is therefore {$130000.00}. 

However, the servicer reports a principal balance of {$130000.00}. 

This reflects a discrepancy of {$1200.00}, likely due to : Payment misapplication, Improper reversal of principal, Failure to apply funds correctly. 
Despite making regular payments and several principal-only payments, the balance does not align with basic amortization math or the servicers transaction log. 

2. Unusual and concerning payment reversals and re-postings The transaction history shows multiple instances of payments being placed into Unapplied Funds, then reversed, reposted, or partially applied, without any explanation. Examples include : - {$600.00} principal-only payment on XX/XX/XXXX was completely reversed, which is highly unusual for a principal-only payment unless done in error. 

- Aregular payment on XX/XX/XXXX was broken into multiple pieces : - {$600.00} unapplied deposit - A {$1100.00} unapplied reversal - A + {$1100.00} reposted payment - A {$18.00} unapplied reversal, followed by a late-charge payment These transactions resemble error corrections rather than legitimate servicing activity. The servicer has not provided any reason for these actions. 

3. Multiple Unapplied Payment entries with unexplained movement of funds. 

Although the net unapplied balance equals zero, the account shows several deposits to unapplied funds, several full and partial reversals, payments being pulled back out of unapplied, funds moving between applied and unapplied without any transparency. 

This pattern suggests potential improper handling of mortgage payments, possible violation of proper application rules under RESPA, and creates substantial confusion and risk for the borrower. 

4. Late fee assessment and reversals without clear rationale A late charge of {$59.00} was assessed on XX/XX/XXXX, then reversed. 
Additional small late-fee payments were posted even though the major fee was subsequently removed. This raises concern that late fees are being generated incorrectly, payments may not be credited on the date received, or the servicers system is cycling payments in a way that falsely triggers fees.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,33569,None,Consent provided,Web,11/26/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17956419
11/25/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"XXXX initiated the loan and promptly sold it to Newrez in XXXX, 2025. The first mortgage payment was due on XX/XX/year>. My wife and I paid this early to XXXX. The payment was received by Newrez on or about XX/XX/XXXX which was a timely payment ( not out of time ). Newrez does not dispute that timely payment was made for XXXX. The first payment was not an automatic ACH payment from an account of ours. But payments thereafter for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX were XXXX payments drawn upon on the first of each month. 

My wife and I were obligated to pay {$14000.00} to Newrez for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX with monthly mortgage payments. Automatic ACH payments were scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX from a money market account of ours at XXXX XXXX Bank. The automated payment went off without a hitch on XX/XX/XXXX, and then Newrez through its own incompetence, negligence, or worse began confusing itself over an entanglement caused by Newrez with another couples bank account who reside in California. Because Newrez got its wires crossed my wife and I paid {$21000.00} for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to keep our mortgage current when, again, we were only to pay {$14000.00}. 

Newrez received all XXXX payments of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Our bank, XXXX XXXX, confirms this and we have shared this with Newrez. We had to make extra mortgage payment in XXXX and XXXX to keep our mortgage current when Newrez refused to accept the XXXX payments received on the first of XXXX and XXXX. We did not we receive any return to our bank account of the payments received by XXXX in XXXX and XXXX. Newrez sent us XXXX checks in XXXX to try to clear up the issue then. The first check was cancelled by me on the recommendation ( there is an audio recording of this made by Newrez XXXX XXXX Newrez 's representative so that he could issue the second check which was refused by Newrez ( without our permission ) when we attempted to draw upon it. We finally received a credit for XXXX of the XXXX extra mortgage payments made in XXXX and XXXX, but not for both. Newrez owes us another mortgage payment either by a check ( that Newrez wont wrongfully refuse ) or another credit. 

I have spoken with a son of the couple whose payments account at XXXX XXXX was apparently confused with a XXXX XXXX account of ours, which beyond our control had been set up by XXXX, the initial mortgagee.

11/12/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Complaint Title : NewRez LLC Conflicting Parent Oversight and Misrepresentation of Ownership Under Rithm Capital Complaint Narrative ( for submission ) I am filing this complaint against NewRez LLC, which services my mortgage. I have discovered that NewRez is part of a corporate structure that misleads both consumers and regulators about its ownership, oversight, and accountability. 

NewRez operates under XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ), which lists NewRez and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing as wholly owned subsidiaries in its SEC filings ( including the XX/XX/year> Form XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX registration statement ). Those filings, verified by outside counsel, show that XXXX servicing income and risk are consolidated into XXXX financials. 

Despite that, when consumers like me submit CFPB complaints, XXXX XXXX tells the XXXX this complaint does not belong to us. Yet NewRez continues to respond, creating a false impression that it acts independently. This contradiction between what XXXX parent tells the SEC and what it tells the CFPB suggests that both companies are using inconsistent representations to avoid accountability. 

Meanwhile, XXXX own servicing practices continue to cause consumer harm : misapplied or unapplied funds, contradictory payment ledgers, unexplained arrears, and repeated technical delinquencies that appear designed to generate late fees and inflate servicing revenue. 
If XXXX truly owns and benefits from XXXX operations as it certifies to the SEC, then these actions reflect a parent-level control failure. 
If XXXX SEC filings are false, then consumers have been misled about who controls their loan servicer. Either way, it represents a serious oversight and governance issue. 

I request that the CFPB : XXXX. Investigate XXXX XXXX payment-application and delinquency reporting system for deceptive or abusive conduct ; and XXXX.

The property was originally listed at a price that reflected its true market condition.

Despite the accurate pricing, Shellpoint responded to the first offer with an extremely high counteroffer that made no market sense given the property condition. At Shellpoints direction, the property was relisted at their inflated counteroffer price. 

As expected, the property did not sell at that price and sat stagnant on the market for months. Eventually, a second offer was received at approximately the same price point as the original listingagain accurately reflecting the true value. Shellpoint came back with a small counteroffer slightly above the buyers offer, which the buyer accepted. 

Shortly thereafter, Shellpoint reversed course and issued the same inflated counteroffer from the previous year, which was completely disconnected from the approved negotiation and the propertys condition. It appears Shellpoint simply looked up the outdated listing ( which still showed their prior counteroffer price ) and reused that number instead of reviewing the current valuation or the accepted offer. 

This arbitrary and inconsistent behavior has now jeopardized the sale again. Shellpoints repeated reliance on unrealistic pricingdespite full knowledge of the severe mold and unsafe conditiondemonstrates a failure to review the file in good faith and in compliance with basic servicing standards.

Economic and Psychological Damage Consumers suffer cumulative harms that regulators have recognized as unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ( UDAAPs ) under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX : XXXX : late fees, negative amortization, inflated escrow shortages, and loss of refinance eligibility. Credit : false delinquency reporting to XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S.C XXXX XXXX ( a ). Emotional : stress, reputational harm, and loss of housing stabilitythe same categories compensated in CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Your recordwhere Shellpoint issued a foreclosure threat while holding documented fundsdemonstrates these harms at the micro level, while the national docket of similar suits proves macro-level replication. XXXX. Market Integrity and Investor Deception Because XXXX XXXX consolidates subsidiary servicing income and uses those revenues to justify public equity sales ( as in its {$750.00} XXXX ATM program ), every falsified consumer ledger inflates corporate earnings. This constitutes a false statement of material fact under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ( b ) and XXXX C.F.R. XXXX, mirroring SEC precedents such as SEC v. XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX. XXXX ). When millions of consumer accounts are handled through the same unlawful accounting method, both retail borrowers and capital-market investors are defrauded simultaneouslythe dual-victim hallmark of a racketeering enterprise. Conclusion : Public Harm Beyond Individual Accounts The identical misconduct confirmed in your casefunds sequestered, statements falsified, wrong company denials, and intimidation via foreclosure noticesappears across dozens of federal dockets, CFPB complaint records, and settlement orders. This establishes : XXXX. Continuity : the enterprise has operated with the same unlawful methods for years ( XXXX ). XXXX. Relationship : the acts are interdependent across XXXX, NewRez, and Shellpoint structures. XXXX. XXXX XXXX : every consumer loan they service is exposed to the same risk of financial and legal injury. Accordingly, the matter transcends private dispute and constitutes a systemic threat to consumer financial protection and market integrity, warranting full enforcement under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ( b ) and referral to the DOJ and SEC for coordinated XXXX and securities-fraud prosecution. Introduction & Background of Servicing Entities The mortgage-servicing group composed of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX parent ), NewRez LLC XXXX XXXX subsidiary ) and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( operating arm ) has drawn increasing regulatory, consumer-class action, and investor scrutiny over multiple jurisdictions and legal theories. These exposures provide a credible backdrop for alleged enterprise misconduct under the XXXX XXXX and Corrupt Organizations Act ( XXXX ) and federal consumer protection statutes : In XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, No. XXXX ( D. Md. ), borrowers alleged that Shellpoint systematically failed to provide required notices under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) and imposed fees in violation of the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act and the Maryland XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and The Bank of New York XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( D. XXXX. ), the complaint alleges a pattern of zombie second-mortgage practices : inflated balances, failure to send statements to XXXX bankruptcy borrowers, and foreclosure threats on dormant liens. In XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, XXXX ( S.D. XXXX. ), a class action alleges that Shellpoint ( via acquired entity SLS ) charged pay-to-pay telephone payment fees up to {$7.00} far above processor cost thereby over-charging borrowers in violation of the Texas Fair Debt Collection XXXX and like statutes in other states. Consumer-complaint data filed with the CFPB show multiple narratives against NewRez/Shellpoint for XXXX XXXX XXXX, including failure to timely credit or apply payments, inadequate responses to RESPA Notices of XXXX, and misleading statements of arrearage. Recent media reporting characterises XXXX XXXX XXXX a legal and foreclosure storm in XXXX as lawsuits mount and servicing portfolio issues proliferate. Independent class-action settlements exist : for example, Shellpoint agreed XXXX a {$500000.00} settlement in XXXX to resolve claims of misleading statements sent to borrowers in XXXX XXXX forbearance. Corporate disclosures and filings indicate Rithm Capital ( formerly New Residential ) consolidates the servicing revenues of NewRez and Shellpoint and sells equity via XXXX ( ATM ) offerings tied to those revenues. I. Overview The enterprise consists of XXXX XXXX XXXX and its wholly-owned subsidiaries NewRez LLC and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, aided by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX counsel and XXXX investment banks as distribution agents for XXXX {$750.00} XXXX ATM equity program.

Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX Layer Operational Arm of Enterprise Finding Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( SMS ), a division operating under the NewRez LLC license, functions as the servicing apparatus for XXXX XXXX XXXX Its executives and department heads directly executed the borrower-facing misconduct that generated unlawful cash-flow inflations later consolidated into Rithms reported earnings. Shellpoints personnel acted as the functional endpoint of the enterprise, producing the predicate acts of mail, wire, and accounting fraud that sustained the parent corporations securities gains. Evidence Internal call transcripts ( XXXX XXXX ) and CFPB complaint filings document continuous misapplication of payments, concealment of unapplied funds exceeding {$100000.00}, and issuance of deceptive delinquency communications while accounts were current. These actions were performed under the authority of Shellpoints servicing leadership and recorded within NewRez-branded portals. Title Name Primary Role Liability Nexus / Predicate Act XXXX XXXX XXXX Dual-hatted XXXX across NewRez and Shellpoint. Authorized application of borrower payments into suspense to inflate servicing liquidity ; predicate act under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ( wire fraud ).

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Oversaw collections and foreclosure pipeline. XXXX issuance of automated foreclosure threats while unapplied funds existedconstituting attempted extortion and unfair practice under XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ( a ). XXXX XXXX XXXX, Servicing Strategy & Process Improvement Engineered data-processing schema linking NewRez and Shellpoint systems.

XXXX XXXX XXXX, Bankruptcy Managed borrower accounts under bankruptcy protection. Failed to apply post-petition payments timely, violating XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ( i ) and RESPA XXXX ( k ).

XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX for performance and audit metrics. Produced internal metrics rewarding retention of unapplied balances ; foundational to Rithms inflated cash-flow throughput. XXXX XXXX leadership orchestrated a servicing model that contravened federal consumer-finance statutes while enriching parent executives through distorted earnings. The call-record evidence establishes knowledge and pattern : each agent acknowledged unapplied funds, confirmed payments, and yet continued delinquency reporting. Key precedents amplify liability : XXXX v. XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : servicer liability for misapplied payments under RESPA XXXX ( f ). Marais v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : failure to investigate borrower disputes constitutes independent damages. XXXX v. XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) : repetitive misapplication satisfies pattern for treble damages. These rulings establish that each missed correction and false delinquency notice is a discrete statutory violation and XXXX predicate. When multiplied across tens of thousands of loans serviced under the same scheme, XXXX acts become the operational backbone of a XXXX ( c ) racketeering enterprise. XXXX XXXX XXXX. Criminal Exposure : Continuous misrepresentations to borrowers and regulators satisfy mail- and wire-fraud predicates ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX, XXXX ) and false-statement liability ( XXXX ). XXXX. Civil Damages : Each RESPA error-resolution failure carries per-violation statutory damages up to {$2000.00} per borrower, multiplied across portfoliosplus treble recovery under XXXX XXXX ( c ). XXXX. Regulatory Sanctions : CFPB and Tennessee XXXX possess concurrent jurisdiction ; patterns mirror prior enforcement in In re XXXX XXXX, File No. XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXX : Shellpoints manipulation of ledgers directly increased XXXX XXXX reported earnings, establishing parent-subsidiary unity under XXXX XXXX XXXX and negating any separate-entity defense.

Damages Quantification : Current documented loss {$100000.00} in unapplied funds plus consequential and punitive damages of {$5.00} millionconstitutes both individual injury and representative harm warranting class treatment. Expanded Enterprise Roster NewRez LLC Leadership Layer Finding NewRez LLC operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of XXXX XXXX XXXX, functioning as the parents licensed mortgage originator and primary residential loan servicer. Despite public separation rhetoric, XXXX officers report upward to the XXXX XXXX XXXX committee, participate in the same deferred-compensation pool, and certify ledger data ultimately consolidated in XXXX XXXX and XXXX filings.

After missing one mortgage payment on a rental property, they immediately filed pre-foreclosure and added more than {$4600.00} in legal fees to my account. I was informed that if I paid both the XXXX and XX/XX/year> payments together by XX/XX/XXXX, the pre-foreclosure status would be removed. I requested and received a reinstatement letter, but it included over {$4600.00} in additional legal fees. This was already the second round of legal fees, as they had charged me more than {$2600.00} in XX/XX/year> as well. 

Now in XXXX, I scheduled and submitted my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. It was processed successfully. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXwo new legal fees were added again. My account currently shows a {$0.00} balance, yet Shellpoint continues attempting to place my loan back into pre-foreclosure even though I do not owe any outstanding payments. They added these new fees after receiving the current months payment. 

This pattern of behavior is predatory and unacceptable. Their repeated and unexplained legal fees, wrongful pre-foreclosure actions, and improper handling of payments strongly suggest abusive and unethical servicing practices.

11/20/25,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Fees or costs after closing,"At closing on XXXX  XXXX, XXXX, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing collected {$19000.00}, which they labeled as Deferred Principal Balance. This was the only partial claim amount disclosed in the payoff statement provided to my closing agent. There was no mention or inclusion of the valid HUD Partial Claim balance of {$10000.00}, which appears in HUDs SMART Portal.

After closing, I reviewed the HUD SMART Portal and learned the following : The {$19000.00} collected by Shellpoint is tied to an old XXXX partial claim that HUD transferred years ago to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

HUD did not include this claim in the payoff amount they generated. 

HUD shows only {$10000.00} as the valid outstanding partial claim for this FHA case. 

HUD has not received any funds from Shellpoint for the {$19000.00} collected at closing. 

Shellpoint has not applied or remitted the funds and has provided no documentation showing where the money went. 

I have been trying to resolve this since my closing date on XX/XX/XXXX. Shellpoint has given me multiple contradictory explanations about the {$19000.00} : Your loan is fully paid and in good standing. 
It may take 60 days for the funds to be distributed.

Those funds belong to Shellpoint ; we dont know why HUD would receive them.

The funds were misappropriated and will be sent.

None of these statements has been supported with any written payoff ledger, documentation, or proof of remittance.

Each time I ask to speak with a supervisor or manager, I am told none are available. On the rare occasions when a supervisor does come on the line, they state they can not assist, do not have access to the information, or can not provide answers. Those interactions end with even more confusion, no documentation, and no resolution. I leave these calls more frustrated, with more unanswered questions than before. 

When I request escalation, the calls are often prolonged without progress, or I am given nonworking email addresses or phone numbers that do not reach a live person. 

Shellpoint has never provided : A payoff application ledger Documentation showing how the {$19000.00} was calculated Any proof that they sent the funds to HUD Any explanation consistent with HUDs records HUDs official records make clear that : Shellpoint collected the wrong partial claim payoff. 

They did not collect the actual outstanding {$10000.00}, and They have not remitted the {$19000.00} to HUD. 

As a result, Shellpoints actions left the valid HUD partial claim unpaid, created a major payoff discrepancy, and blocked all efforts to resolve it directly with either the servicer or HUD.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,32506,None,Consent provided,Web,11/20/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17776591

On XX/XX/XXXX, NewRez issued a letter claiming my property was in a flood zone and that I had 45 days to obtain coverage. The letter did not arrive until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, they sent a second letter falsely stating I had been notified a month ago. I immediately purchased private flood insurance for $ XXXXyear and submitted proof twice ; my insurance agent also submitted it. 

Despite receiving valid coverage, NewRez force-placed a flood policy on XX/XX/XXXX and withdrew {$920.00} from my escrow without authorization, creating a shortage and increasing my monthly payment. When questioned, they claimed they never received my insurance documentation, refunded only {$140.00}, and said the remaining amount was to cover previous monthsmonths when they had never informed me that insurance was required. 

I contacted my original lender and confirmed the property is not in a flood zone. FEMA maps show only a distant portion of the acreage is flood-designated, not the home. When I presented this evidence, NewRez changed their explanation and falsely stated we were recently audited by FEMA. After escalation, a manager admitted NewRez made a mistake, yet they are still attempting to raise my monthly payment based on the force-placed policy.

This appears to be improper force-placement, failure to acknowledge proof of insurance, misuse of escrow funds, and deceptive communication. These actions have caused financial harm and unnecessary distress.

I am requesting full reimbursement of all force-placed charges, correction of my escrow balance, restoration of the proper monthly payment, and written confirmation that flood insurance is not required.

My grandmother left behind a home that is not paid off, and is serviced by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) / Request for Information seeking a full and complete mortgage accounting, including but not limited to payment history, application of payments, fees, escrow activity, interest calculations, and the current balance justification. This request was made pursuant to RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) and Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.36 ). 7 months later and I have not received anything. 

The reason for my request is because the property was purchased in XXXX for approximately {$330000.00} at an interest rate of 3.5 %. Nearly 20 years later, Shellpoint claims the loan balance is still {$230000.00}, with monthly payments a little over {$2200.00}, which raises serious concerns regarding how payments, interest, and fees have been applied. In order to protect the estate and avoid foreclosure, I paid over {$20000.00} to reinstate the mortgage. Because of the questionable balance and payment history, I formally requested a full accounting in writing in XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX v. XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) confirm that post-notice ledger changes are actionable. 
4. Regulatory Notice : These materials have been transmitted to CFPB, TDFI, and the South Carolina AG.

Independent audio and bank records confirm every payment.

Continued reporting of delinquency after such notice satisfies the scienter element for willful violation under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ).

Demand for Immediate Action Within 10 business days, provide written certification that : all unapplied funds have been permanently applied to principal as of their original receipt dates ; no further retroactive alterations will occur in this accounts ledger ; and a complete, unedited transaction log ( with user IDs and timestamps ) will be furnished for regulatory verification. 

Failure to comply will constitute continuing violations subject to treble damages under 18 U.S.C. 1964 ( c ) and referral to DOJ Financial Crimes Division for falsification of federally regulated records. 
Supplemental Findings XX/XX/XXXX Call Series and Ledger Correlation Recordings from XXXX customer-service calls between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX confirm that NewRez / Shellpoint agents repeatedly acknowledged an unapplied balance of roughly {$12.00} XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX an agent stated that {$750.00} would be added to complete the XXXX payment cycle and that an additional payment was scheduled for XXXX. Subsequent ledgers show that entry briefly applied to XXXX, then vanished in later exports. 

By the companys own words, XXXX of XXXX scenarios must be true : 1. If those reversals were errors, the servicer concedes its accounting system produces spontaneous inaccuracies and therefore fails the record-integrity requirements of 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( ii ).

2. If those reversals were accurate, then the later removal of the same entries constitutes intentional alteration of a financial record, violating SarbanesOxley 802 ( a ) ( 1 ) and Reg X 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ).

Either explanation establishes systemic control failure. Each call transcript aligns with a contemporaneous ledger change, showing a persistent pattern of acknowledgement followed by inconsistent remediation. These admissions demonstrate not isolated employee confusion but a corrupted servicing platform that rewrites transaction history after contact with borrowers. 

Addendum B Recorded Admissions and Chronological Proof of Ledger Manipulation Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX recorded phone calls with NewRez/Shellpoint representatives confirm recurring acknowledgment of unapplied funds and ledger confusion. Key examples include : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Agent confirms total owed {$5.00} XXXX with {$2.00} XXXX unapplied, promising correction once the {$5.00} XXXX XXXX payment posts. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Representative verifies receipt of {$750.00} payment, confirmation # XXXX, to fulfill XXXX, then states unapplied balance will clearexactly matching the ledger entries later altered or deleted. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Follow-up agents admit continued system errors and inability to reconcile unapplied amounts. 
XX/XX/XXXX series ( XXXX calls ) Agents attempt account matching, discuss refinancing, and again acknowledge ongoing discrepancies. 

Each call corresponds to a specific change in the XXXX exported ledgers ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). The recordings establish real-time knowledge of ledger corruption and failed remediation. If NewRez classifies the {$750.00} correction as an error, it admits a broken system under 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ) ( XXXX ) ( ii ) ; if it claims the entry was accurate, then its later removal constitutes record falsification under SarbanesOxley 802 ( a ) ( 1 ).

These synchronized data and audio records eliminate any plausible isolated-employee defense and prove that multiple representatives were aware of and documented the same unapplied-funds problem while the ledgers were being rewritten. 

Addendum C Historical Recorded Admissions ( XXXX XXXX ) The evidentiary record now includes calls from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, showing identical ledger irregularities and staff acknowledgments long before the XX/XX/XXXX unapplied-funds crisis. 

XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Agent discusses mismatched payoff amounts and apologizes for system quoting errors. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min series ) XXXX separate calls confirm a one-time {$2.00} XXXX payment scheduled against an account balance of {$5.00} XXXX, the same figure later appearing in ledgers under multiple classifications ( Regular, Unapplied, or missing ). 
XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX min ) Representative again requests full SSN verification, states inability to locate the correct balance, and transfers the call between departments without reconciliation. 

These recordings establish that the same ledger malfunctions and unapplied-fund anomalies existed at least XXXX months before the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sequence. The repetition across XXXX satisfies the pattern or practice element under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and supports a finding of reckless disregard under 15 U.S.C. 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ).

Combined with Addenda A and B ( ledger comparisons and later admissions ), this chronology demonstrates : 1. Continuous system errors from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ; 2. Ongoing employee recognition without remediation ; 3. Knowledge at the supervisory level that balances and classifications were inconsistent month to month. 

Under XXXX v. XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), such a sustained failure to correct misapplied payments after repeated borrower contact constitutes willful RESPA/TILA non-compliance.

Formal Notice of Record-Tampering and Oversight Breach NewRez LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

NewRez LLC is now on documented notice that its servicing personnel repeatedly acknowledged unapplied-fund discrepancies and system errors during recorded calls spanning XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, while the same transactions were later altered or deleted in XXXX separate ledger exports covering identical dates. Each recording demonstrates contemporaneous knowledge of a malfunctioning or manipulated accounting system, yet no corrective audit trail was implementedconstituting a continuing violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( ii ) ( failure to maintain complete and accurate records ) and 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( failure to credit payments as of date received ). The XX/XX/XXXX sequence, in which a {$750.00} payment was first confirmed, then removed from later ledger versions, converts these acknowledgments into prima facie evidence of record falsification under SarbanesOxley Act 802 ( a ) ( 1 ) and potential obstruction under 18 U.S.C. 1519.

Because NewRez and Shellpoint operate as wholly-owned subsidiaries of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX this misconduct ascends directly to XXXX XXXX under the oversight-liability standards of In re XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. Ch. XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX ) ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. Ch. XXXX ). XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( CEO ), XXXX XXXX ( CFO ), and XXXX XXXX ( Chief Legal Officer ) bear a non-delegable duty to establish and monitor information systems capable of detecting precisely these compliance failures. Their constructive knowledge of falsified ledgers, coupled with active regulatory notice, satisfies the scienter element for XXXX board liability and creates potential exposure under SOX 302 and 404 for false internal-control certifications. XXXX enrichment through uncredited borrower payments further implicates 18 U.S.C. 1962 ( c ) and 1964 ( c ) ( civil RICO ) as a continuing enterprise benefiting from record manipulation.

Immediate action is required : ( 1 ) full forensic preservation of all servicing-system databases, ( 2 ) disclosure of these control failures to investors in the next Form 10-Q/K pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 13b2-1, and ( 3 ) restitution to affected borrowers consistent with 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) and 15 U.S.C. 1640 ( a ).

I began sending Notice of Error, Qualified written Request, and verification certified letters to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicer in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. The first letter requested that Shellpoint Mortgage verify our loan. Shellpoint Mortgage Servicer. Shellpoint responded twice with the same answer, stating that they did not have to verify our mortgage. Additionally, each time they responded within around 10 days with a letter asking for 30 days to examine my concerns. They would always respond after 30 days with a refusal to correct anything. It was not until I wrote my Senator 's office to ask for their assistance in requesting that Shellpoint Mortgage correct egregious errors, such as explaining erroneous fees, {$64000.00} attached to the end of the loan, making our loan a Conventional Loan with a 6 % adjustable rate. However, the loan was and is an FHA loan with a 4 % interest rate. Nevertheless, after making the corrections, they continue to add on additional fees, not give us a reasonable loan modification. The loan modification was unattainable and impossible for us to pay. However, we received assistance from XXXX XXXX XXXX, but Shellpoint Mortgage did not apply the payments to our mortgage. Lastly, since XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicer has refused our monthly payments. Once, one of the representatives told me that an attorney was representing me.

08/29/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this URGENT complaint against Caliber Home Loans as previous mortgage servicer for loan # XXXX on my primary residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  XXXX. Caliber created fundamental chain of title defects and validation failures during their servicing period that enabled the current ILLEGAL foreclosure sale scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, by subsequent servicers. Their systematic violations of the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ), RESPA ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35-41 ), and servicing transfer requirements created the foundation for ongoing elder abuse against vulnerable XXXX homeowners, threatening immediate loss of my {>= $1,000,000} home. 

CRITICAL VIOLATIONS : 1. FDCPA DEBT VALIDATION FAILURES CREATING FORECLOSURE FOUNDATION DEFECTS During Caliber 's servicing period, they received comprehensive debt validation demands challenging fundamental aspects of the loan and their authority, including : - Amount owed and calculation methodology verification - Chain of title and assignment documentation - Original creditor and current note holder identity - Payment history accounting and accuracy - Authority to service and collect on the loan Caliber provided NO RESPONSES failing to establish proper validation under FDCPA 1692g ( b ). Their NON RESPONSE has created chain of title gaps that subsequent servicers ( Shellpoint ) are now exploiting to conduct unauthorized foreclosure against vulnerable elderly homeowners. This systematic validation failure enabled ongoing elder abuse through coordinated foreclosure fraud.

2. IMPROPER SERVICING TRANSFER VIOLATIONS ENABLING FORECLOSURE ABUSE When Caliber transferred servicing to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, they failed to comply with RESPA servicing transfer requirements ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.33 ), creating defects that enable current foreclosure abuse : - Failed to transfer complete and accurate payment records- Did not provide proper chain of title documentation - Failed to correct known identity issues ( wrong borrower names ) - Transferred defective servicing files without resolution of disputes- Did not ensure FDCPA compliance by subsequent servicer These transfer violations created the foundation for current foreclosure proceedings against wrong borrower names and without proper validation, enabling systematic elder abuse. 

XXXX. IDENTITY FRAUD CREATION AND PERPETUATION Caliber accepted payments under correct legal names XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( court-ordered name change XXXX ) while maintaining loan records showing wrong borrower identities "" XXXX XXXX XXXX and "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX When transferring servicing, they failed to correct these identity discrepancies, enabling subsequent foreclosure fraud. This violates : - FDCPA 1692e ( false representations ) - RESPA transfer requirements for accurate records - Consumer protection laws requiring proper borrower identification Their perpetuation of identity fraud during servicing transfer enabled current foreclosure against non-existent parties, constituting systematic elder abuse through procedural manipulation. 

XXXX. RECORDS MAINTENANCE FAILURES ENABLING FORECLOSURE DEFECTS During their servicing period, Caliber failed to maintain complete and accurate servicing records required under federal regulations : - Incomplete payment history and accounting records- Missing chain of title and assignment documentation - Defective borrower identity information - Inadequate dispute resolution documentation - Failure to properly document modification attempts These records maintenance failures were transferred to subsequent servicers, creating the foundation for current unauthorized foreclosure proceedings and enabling systematic elder abuse against vulnerable homeowners. 

XXXX. ELDER ABUSE FACILITATION THROUGH SERVICING DEFECTS Caliber 's systematic violations during their servicing period specifically targeted and enabled ongoing abuse of vulnerable XXXX homeowners by : - Creating validation defects that prevent effective defense - Failing to correct identity fraud enabling wrong-party foreclosure - Transferring defective records that obscure borrower rights- Establishing foundation for coordinated foreclosure abuse - Enabling subsequent servicer violations through defective transfer This pattern demonstrates facilitation of elder abuse through systematic servicing violations designed to create foreclosure vulnerability. 

XXXX. COORDINATED SYSTEMATIC ABUSE NETWORK PARTICIPATION Caliber participated in coordinated systematic abuse involving multiple entities ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX ) by : - Creating servicing defects that enable coordinated foreclosure - Failing to establish proper chain of title documentation - Perpetuating identity fraud across servicing transfers - Maintaining non-response patterns to borrower disputes- Facilitating elder abuse through defective servicing practices This coordination demonstrates systematic targeting of vulnerable elderly consumers through coordinated servicing violations. 

PATTERN OF SYSTEMATIC ELDER ABUSE FACILITATION : Caliber 's servicing violations created the foundational defects that enable current foreclosure abuse against vulnerable elderly homeowners. Their systematic failures in validation, records maintenance, and servicing transfer created vulnerabilities specifically exploited to target seniors facing foreclosure through coordinated industry abuse. 

IMMEDIATE HARM AND IRREPARABLE INJURY : - Imminent loss of {>= $1,000,000} primary residence on XX/XX/XXXX due to defects Caliber created - Elderly borrowers ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) facing homelessness enabled by Caliber 's servicing violations- Severe emotional distress from systematic abuse enabled by Caliber 's defective practices - Financial devastation from defending against foreclosure built on Caliber 's violations - Violation of fundamental due process through coordinated servicing abuse - Elder abuse through systematic servicing defects targeting vulnerable consumers SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ATTACHED : - Previous CFPB complaint against Caliber ( ID : XXXX ) showing systematic violations - Debt validation demands sent to Caliber with inadequate responses - Servicing transfer notifications showing defective record transfers- Payment records showing correct names while loan records show wrong names - Chain of title challenges sent to Caliber without proper response - Evidence of coordinated abuse pattern involving multiple servicers - Documentation of ongoing foreclosure enabled by Caliber 's violations URGENT RELIEF REQUESTED : XXXX. IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY INVESTIGATION of Caliber 's systematic servicing violations enabling foreclosure abuse XXXX. EMERGENCY ORDER requiring Caliber to correct records defects enabling current foreclosure 3. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE with FDCPA validation requirements before any foreclosure proceeds 4. SERVICING TRANSFER AUDIT and corrections of defective records transfers 5. ELDER ABUSE INVESTIGATION and criminal referral for facilitation of systematic abuse 6. SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES for servicing violations enabling coordinated foreclosure fraud 7. RESTITUTION for damages enabled by Caliber 's systematic violations ( estimated $ XXXX ) XXXX. INJUNCTION against future defective servicing practices targeting elderly consumers XXXX. REFERRAL to federal banking regulators for comprehensive servicing oversight XXXX. COORDINATION with current servicer investigations to address systematic abuse pattern PREVIOUS SERVICER ACCOUNTABILITY : Caliber can not escape responsibility for creating the foundational defects enabling current foreclosure abuse. Their systematic servicing violations created vulnerabilities specifically exploited to target vulnerable elderly homeowners through coordinated industry abuse requiring immediate regulatory intervention. 

COORDINATED SYSTEMATIC ABUSE REQUIRING COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE : This complaint is part of systematic violations involving coordinated CFPB complaints against multiple entities ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) regarding the same illegal foreclosure proceedings. Caliber 's role as previous servicer who created foundational defects makes them critically responsible for enabling ongoing elder abuse.

This acknowledgment subjects its conduct not only to mortgage-servicing rules under RESPA and TILA, but also to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. When viewed alongside the five contradictory ledgers and fourteen recorded calls, the companys statements to regulators and consumers constitute multiple violations of XXXXXXXX XXXX  and XXXX. 



Evidence XXXX. Written and Verbal Disclosures Customer letters and voicemail greetings include : This is NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, a debt collector. This is an attempt to collect a debt. 
Each of the XXXX recordings contains that disclaimer or its equivalent, confirming statutory self-designation. 
XXXX. Contradictory Account Statements Five ledgers show alternating balances and unapplied-fund totals. 
Example : the XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$750.00} was acknowledged on that date, removed by XX/XX/XXXX, and missing by XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX. Post-Dispute Collection Activity After formal Notices of Error ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, collection communications continued : payment reminders, delinquency notices, and payoff calls. 
Each communication occurred after NewRez had actual notice of dispute. 
XXXX. Regulatory Notice XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed receipt of the complaint and attachments. 
OCC referral and CFPB filings establish that NewRez knew or should have known the debt was disputed and under review.

Interpretation A. Statutory Framework Statute Requirement Violation Evident 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) Prohibits false representation of the character or amount of a debt.

Conflicting balances across ledgers and call statements.

1692f ( 1 ) Forbids collection of any amount not expressly authorized by the agreement or law.

Late fees assessed while funds held unapplied.

1692g ( b ) Collection must cease until verification provided when a debt is disputed in writing.

Calls and notices continued after XXXX receipt. 
XXXX ( XXXX ) Bars oppressive or harassing conduct in connection with debt collection. 
Repeated contradictory calls causing borrower distress. 
XXXX Case-Law XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : misstated balance constitutes FDCPA violation even if later corrected. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : form responses after notice show systemic disregard. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) : failure to apply payments and continued collection = willful violation. 
XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : mortgage servicers that regularly collect debts are debt collectors under FDCPA. 

XXXX Overlap with RESPA and TILA Because NewRez functions simultaneously as servicer and debt collector, each inaccurate ledger entry and collection notice doubles as a violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( failure to correct errors ) and 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( failure to credit payments ). Courts treat concurrent violations as aggravating factors supporting enhanced statutory damages.

Risk Impact XXXX. Statutory Damages Up to {$1000.00} per consumer under FDCPA ( 1692k ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ), plus actual damages and attorney fees. 
Each discrete communication that misstates a balance can be counted separately for pattern evidence. 
XXXX. Class-Action Exposure Uniform disclosures ( This is a debt collector ) plus uniform misconduct ( unapplied payments, contradictory balances ) meet Rule 23 commonality requirements. 
Potential class size : all borrowers serviced by NewRez during the same software period. 
XXXX. Regulatory Penalties CFPB can impose civil money penalties under XXXX XXXX 12 U.S.C. 5565 ( XXXX XXXX Debt Collector Admission ( NewRez Website Disclosure ) Finding NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing publicly declares on its corporate website that it is a debt collector. This admission establishes standing under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) for all servicing communications and ledger activity, converting every false, misleading, or harassing act into a statutory violation. 



Evidence Source : NewRez official website ( www.newrez.com ) Servicing Legal Disclosure.

Text Extract : NewRez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is a debt collector. This is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.

Metadata : Screenshot captured XX/XX/XXXX showing official XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  XXXX. 



Interpretation XXXX. FDCPA Jurisdiction Confirmed. 
Because NewRez explicitly identifies itself as a debt collector, it is subject to FDCPA provisions regardless of whether it also claims servicer status. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) entities that regularly collect debts, even on behalf of another, are debt collectors within the Acts scope. 
XXXX. Corroboration of Pattern. 
This statement validates every recorded call beginning with a debt collector disclosure. 
The XXXX recordings and XXXX contradictory ledgers now represent direct violations of 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) ( false representation of amount due ), 1692f ( 1 ) ( unlawful fee or balance ), and 1692g ( b ) ( continuing collection after written dispute ). 
XXXX. Intersection with RESPA/TILA.

Since the same conduct ( misapplied payments and false balances ) violates RESPA 1024.35 and TILA 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ), the FDCPA status adds treble exposurecivil liability under three separate statutory schemes. 
XXXX. Governance Implications for XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX executives file consolidated financials certifying the accuracy of subsidiary operations under XXXX XXXX and XXXX. 
Continued false accounting or collection by a self-declared debt collector constitutes reckless board-level oversight failure under XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) standards. 



Risk Impact Individual Liability : Each  misleading ledger, fee, or communication can yield up to {$1000.00} per violation plus actual damages and attorney fees ( 15 U.S.C. 1692k ).

Class Exposure : The uniform debt collector disclaimer ensures class commonality ; thousands of borrowers experience identical communications.

Regulatory Consequences : The CFPB can now frame this as a hybrid FDCPA/RESPA systemic case a rare and high-penalty designation.

Addendum Federal Confirmation of Debt Collection Classification Finding The CFPBs complaint taxonomy for mortgage debt explicitly includes categories such as false statements or representation, attempts to collect debt not owed, and took or threatened to take negative or legal action.

By routing your complaint through this form, the CFPB recognizes NewRezs conduct as debt-collection activitynot simply mortgage servicing.

Observed Categories : False statements or representation ( trying to collect wrong amount ) Attempts to collect debt not owed Written notification about debt Took or threatened to take negative or legal action ( damage credit ) Each of these complaint tracks is derived from 15 U.S.C. 1692ef, confirming CFPB treats misapplied-payment servicing as a collection matter, not a servicing matter. 



Interpretation XXXX. Regulatory Acknowledgment : Submitting via this channel triggers CFPBs Debt Collection oversight branch, not its Mortgage Servicing division, meaning the Bureau itself recognizes NewRezs legal identity as a debt collector under FDCPA. 
XXXX. Scope of Violations : False Statements ( 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) ) Contradictory ledgers and payoff figures.

Collection of Debt Not Owed ( 1692f ( 1 ) ) Holding unapplied payments while asserting delinquency. 
Threatened Negative Action ( 1692e ( 5 ) ) Credit reporting or foreclosure threats despite active disputes. 
Failure to Cease Collection ( 1692g ( b ) ) Continued calls after formaXXXX XXXX 
XXXX. Procedural Significance : Once logged in this category, your complaint becomes part of CFPBs annual FDCPA enforcement data set, which can later substantiate a pattern or practice claim for class litigation. 



Risk Impact Administrative : CFPB now has the statutory authority to impose civil money penalties under 12 U.S.C. 5565 ( c ). 
Litigation : Class-action attorneys can cite CFPBs own classification as proof of industry-recognized debt-collection conduct. 
Governance : XXXX XXXX can not argue servicing exemption because their subsidiarys federal regulator formally tagged the behavior as debt collection. 

Governance and Securities Liability Integration : Rithm Capitals Oversight Failure XXXX. Framework : Parent-Subsidiary Accountability XXXX XXXX XXXX wholly owns and controls NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, consolidating all subsidiary performance into its SEC filings and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX certifications.

XXXX. Finding : Systemic Compliance Collapse at Subsidiary Level Evidence shows that NewRez/Shellpoint : Admitted being a debt collector under the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ).

Engaged in false balance reporting, misapplication of payments, and pre-dispute foreclosure threats.

Produced contradictory ledgers and call transcripts acknowledging unapplied funds.

Issued automated responses instead of substantive RESPA 1024.35 error-resolution letters.

I called shell point and told them that I'm still going through bankruptcy and I can't pay almost {$700.00} a month.

shell point answer was because of your bankruptcy you can pay how ever you want as much as you like and the attorney fees can be paid when ever.

I did miss three payments of {$500.00} that's {$1500.00} I have been calling shell point every week making {$100.00} payments and I'm still under bankruptcy protection.

shell point claims that the mortgage is behind almost {$7000.00} which makes no sense.

11/23/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"Shellpoint/NewRez Misconduct and Incorrect Credit Reporting I am submitting this complaint to request immediate CFPB intervention regarding Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing/NewRez LLC due to ongoing misconduct, harassment, fraudulent misrepresentation, and improper credit reporting. This account is currently in active litigation in XXXX XXXX Superior Court for servicing malpractice, fraud, and negligence, yet Shellpoint continues to violate multiple federal laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, RESPA, and state consumer protection statutes.

1. Improper and Incorrect Credit Reporting Shellpoint has continuously and knowingly reported false derogatory information to the credit bureaus on a loan that is : Under active litigation, and therefore should not be reported as a valid debt in default.

Subject to verified disputes ( over 60 individual disputes filed with all three credit bureaus ). 

Already disputed with CFPB once previously, with no corrective action taken by Shellpoint. 

Disputed formally by my attorney, who sent Shellpoint and the CFPB a written dispute letter. We have received no response from Shellpoint acknowledging or correcting the reporting. 


Despite receiving repeated disputes and notices from myself, my attorney, and the court, Shellpoint continues to report : Delinquencies that are not legally valid. 

A foreclosure status they have no legal standing to initiate. 

Ongoing negative marks without investigating or responding to any disputes. 


This constitutes willful and reckless violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

2. Improper Foreclosure Actions During Active Litigation Shellpoint/NewRez attempted to serve me foreclosure paperwork while the loan is actively being litigated in XXXX XXXX Superior Court for fraud and malpractice related directly to their servicing actions. 

Serving foreclosure notices during ongoing litigation is : A violation of due process. 

A violation of RESPA loss mitigation rules. 

A retaliatory and coercive action intended to pressure or intimidate me into abandoning litigation. 


This is now documented in the court record. 

3. Providing Fake Attorney Information / Misrepresentation Shellpoint provided my attorney with the name and contact information of a supposed attorney representing NewRez/Shellpoint.

Upon investigation, my attorney discovered that : This attorney does NOT represent Shellpoint or NewRez in any capacity.

The provided contact information was false.

Shellpoint knowingly misrepresented legal counsel to obstruct communication and delay resolution.

This is a serious act of fraudulent misrepresentation, intended to interfere with ongoing legal proceedings and prevent proper legal correspondence.

4. Harassment and Harmful Communication Practices Shellpoint has repeatedly violated the FDCPA by engaging in : Continuous phone calls to me and to members of my family at all hours of the day and night.

Repetitive letters and notices ignoring litigation status.

Contact after being told I am represented by counsel.

Contact after being informed the debt is disputed.

They have intentionally disregarded : Notices from my attorney, Written cease-and-desist instructions, Legal restrictions related to accounts in litigation.

5. Refusal to Acknowledge Litigation or Provide Required Documentation Despite being notified multiple times that this matter is part of an active Superior Court case, Shellpoint continues to : Ignore all litigation updates, Send inaccurate statements, Demand payment on a disputed, fraudulent loan, Refuse to freeze reporting or collections, Fail to provide required documentation under RESPA and FCRA. 


6. Prior CFPB Complaint Ignored A prior CFPB complaint was submitted, and my attorney also sent formal correspondence to the CFPB and to Shellpoint. Shellpoint never responded appropriately and continued their misconduct.

I am resubmitting that letter again today along with this updated statement.

-- - Requested Relief I am requesting the CFPB to take the following actions immediately : 1. Order Shellpoint/NewRez to cease all collection and foreclosure activity pending the outcome of the active litigation.

2. Order Shellpoint to correct and remove all inaccurate negative credit reporting related to this disputed and litigated account.

3. Investigate Shellpoints fraudulent misrepresentation regarding legal counsel.

4. Investigate Shellpoints harassment practices, including calling family members and making contact outside allowed hours.

5. Require Shellpoint to acknowledge the active XXXX XXXX Superior Court litigation and comply with all legal requirements for disputed debts.

01/09/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),"I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) under the Homeowners Protection Act.

My mortgage loan was formally recast ( re-amortized ) in XX/XX/2025, following a lender-approved principal curtailment. As part of this recast, the amortization schedule was revised. My LTV dropped to well below 78 %.

Subsequent to the recast, my mortgage loan was transferred to a new loan servicer. Despite the transfer, the recast and updated amortization schedule remain part of the permanent loan record.

Under 12 U.S.C. 4901 ( 18 ), scheduled amortization includes an amortization schedule as modified by the lender and the borrower.

Under 12 U.S.C. 4902 ( b ), PMI must terminate automatically when the principal balance, based on the scheduled amortization ( or as otherwise modified ), is first scheduled to reach 78 % of the original value of the property.

Despite the recast in XX/XX/2025 and the existence of a modified amortization schedule, the current loan servicer failed to update the PMI termination date and collected PMI for months before transferring my loan, effectively disregarding the lender-approved re-amortization.

I have requested confirmation of the PMI termination date using the post-recast amortization schedule, but the servicer has failed to provide a legally supported explanation for continuing to rely on the original schedule.

I am requesting : 1. Written confirmation that PMI termination is being calculated using the post-recast amortization schedule, consistent with 12 U.S.C. 4901 ( 18 ) and 4902 ( b ) ; or 2.

I just received my monthly new statement from Shellpoint, for payment due XX/XX/XXXX. I was waiting to see if the issue was resolve. Which, unfortunately it was not even address ; how I am accountable for the legal charge/fee. 

Shellpoint states in the opening letter. Page 1, first paragraph that Shellpoint was addressing the account status, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( LPI ) process and Escrow Analysis. But you conveniently left out the main cause of the complaint which is a legal charge/fee still on XX/XX/XXXX for {$490.00}. This has not been definitely shown that I was in default to trigger any legal action for this charge. 
To simple say, this was an error, that this is a legal charge/fee forwarded from the earlier servicer ( Rushmore ) is not adequate. Someone has to explain how and where did I default causing this legal charge/fee. 
Shellpoint records seem to show a XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$2900.00}, while my bank account ( ACH ), clearly shows that payments were withdraw from my account on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX for {$2900.00} for XXXX. Then again on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX for {$2900.00} for XXXX and yet again, on XX/XX/XXXX to Shellpoint for XXXX each for {$2900.00}. Again, no default on borrower side. 
Please note any transfers of fund between old and new servicers during the servicer transition period is out of my control, and should be 100 % transparent to me, the borrower. There is also a transfer grace period of 45 to 60 days. It looks like Shellpoint may have been just a little premature and overzealous with the XX/XX/XXXX Foreclosure notice. My banks records, show that I was never late or in default, to trigger the start of any type of legal action. 

So again, explain the {$490.00} legal charge/fee that still, and only appears, on Shellpoint statement and not on any of XXXX statements. 

The XX/XX/XXXX double payment of {$5900.00} was for XXXX and XXXX. Not XXXX and XXXX. The double payment was made because I was under the impression I canceled my XX/XX/XXXX payment due to suspected fraud. Only to find out later it was not cancelled in time and it clear my account. So, the double payment should have gone to XXXX and XXXX. Clearly your records are misleading. 

But none of this is the issue since you agree the account is current. Now please explain the {$490.00} from XX/XX/XXXX? Mind you XXXX and I were on the same page ( loan was current and had been since they took over the account in XX/XX/XXXX ) at the time of the transfer. So please explain as the correct servicer the {$490.00} legal charge/fee as it now still appears on you XX/XX/XXXX statement which is due XX/XX/XXXX. This legal charge and fee first appeared on Shellpoint XX/XX/XXXX statement, as {$490.00}, and you admit to sending out a Foreclosure notice on XX/XX/XXXX. But yet Shellpoint says this was due to a XXXX XX/XX/XXXX issue. If this is a coincidence then have XXXX fully explain this $ XXXX {$490.00} charge/fee. 

Please show me where and how I ( the borrower ) am accountable for the $ XXXX {$490.00} legal charge/fee? 

Shellpoints rhetoric, about homeowner insurance expiring is moot and, only muddies the water, along with its XXXX response to CFPB. It hinds the fact that XXXX had the latest insurance policy covering from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Why is it Shellpoint did not know this, is beyond the facts. Its sad that I ( the borrower ), after giving Shellpoint the insurance carriers name and policy number that I had to get involve to send Shellpoint the insurance declaration statement. Shellpoints XX/XX/XXXX letter, is not the only mistake that was made. As the current servicer you are burden with the task of fully explaining this charge. Or have it removed and never to return.

Then I was charged {$700.00} for their illegal foreclosure during my active bankruptcy case. I was then falsely lied on about not paying my mortgage which the mortgage company had mailed my payments back. Finally, they had requested that my active bankruptcy be kicked out for nonpayment. I had not missed any payments since XXXX. That was 10 years of not missing a payment. After my bankruptcy was restarted I then resumed my payments that were set in XX/XX/XXXX at {$390.00} per month by ShellPoint. This amount was confirmed by the Judge when I had my confirmation. So in XXXX I sent the payment of {$390.00}. But my XXXX payment was set at over {$2000.00}. I struggle to pay it but I did. Every time I pay my mortgage is via certified check via FedX on the XXXX of the month. However, for XXXX they charged me over {$350.00} late fees/month.

Since then ShellPoint has filed with the Bankruptcy XXXX that I can not afford to pay my mortgage. My mortgage has been paid every month since then for the {$1100.00} which is the true current amount that I was quoted after filing my bankruptcy. I am constantly being harassed by the sharks that are swimming in the water begging me to sell now at less XXXX of what my mortgage has been paid over the last XXXX years.

10/26/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I am filing this formal complaint against Newrez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for multiple violations of federal and North Carolina mortgage servicing laws , including dual tracking, refusal to accept payments, and failure to provide timely loss mitigation decisions. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have submitted four complete forbearance applications due to documented financial and medical hardship. Each application included all required financial, income, and hardship documentation. Despite this, Shellpoint repeatedly delayed responses, requested duplicate documents, and failed to issue any written decision. 
While my fourth complete application ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was confirmed as under review, Shellpoints foreclosure attorney sent a Notice of Foreclosure dated XX/XX/XXXX, received on XX/XX/XXXX. This is a clear case of illegal dual tracking under 12 CFR 1024.41 ( f ), which prohibits foreclosure activity while a complete loss mitigation application is pending.

At the same time, Shellpoint blocked my online account and refused to accept even partial payments. I made multiple written and verbal offers between October 1524, 2025, to make good faith payments, but was told, as per company policy, I can not accept payments. This refusal appears intended to accelerate delinquency and justify foreclosure despite my willingness and ability to pay. 
Shellpoints conduct has caused severe emotional and financial distress. My wife and I are both over XXXX XXXX XXXX, each with serious medical XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was hospitalized for a XXXX and XXXX emergency. Even after being informed of my hospitalization, Shellpoint continued to send duplicate document requests and conflicting lettersone claiming the account was under review, and another advancing foreclosure. 
This pattern of misconduct constitutes violations of RESPA/Regulation X ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ), Dodd-Frank UDAAP provisions, Fair Housing Act protections for elderly and XXXX homeowners, and North Carolinas Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act ( GS 75-1.1 ).

We are not seeking forgiveness or special treatmentonly the opportunity to make payments and avoid unnecessary foreclosure while recovering from documented hardship. I am scheduled to begin part-time employment in XX/XX/XXXX and will be able to resume regular payments at that time. 
I respectfully request NCCOBs urgent intervention to : 1. Require Shellpoint to cease all foreclosure activity immediately ; 2. Issue a written decision on my pending forbearance application ; 3. Remove payment restrictions and allow me to make payments ; 4. Grant a temporary forbearance ( 36 months ) to recover medically and financially ; and 5.

11/18/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"THE XXXX XXXX ( WEAPONIZED VERSION ) A Philosophical Indictment With Legal Citations You told regulators : NewRez has nothing to do with XXXX. 
You repeated it to the CFPB. 
You sent it to state agencies. 
You embedded it in responses designed to reroute complaints. 

Yet your own XXXX speaks differently. 
On camera. 
With no confusion. 
No hesitation. 

He says : Businesses in XXXX ( XXXX ) Our MSR perspective ( XXXX ) Our operating center in XXXX ( XXXX ) Our complaint trackers ( XXXX ) Our digital tools ( XXXX ) Our capital keeping that capital ( XXXX ) Two truths can not coexist when they are opposites. 
A company can not be both integrated and unrelated. 
A platform can not be unified and independent. 
A XXXX can not speak in the voice of an organization he supposedly is not part of. 

This is the paradox that exposes the lie. 



I. The Paradox as Legal Evidence of Deception Under federal law, a contradiction of this magnitude triggers multiple statutory violations. 

UDAAP Deception 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) prohibits practices that mislead consumers or regulators. 
A representation is deceptive when it is material and contradictory to reality. 

You manufactured a parallel universe : The regulator universe where NewRez XXXX The public universe where NewRez = XXXX  platform voice Your CEOs statements constitute admissions against interest. 
Your filings constitute misrepresentations. 

UDAAP Unfairness 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( c ) : conduct causing substantial injury that can not be avoided by consumers. 
Consumers can not avoid an injury if the servicer hides who controls the platform. 

Misrouting Jurisdiction 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) forbids entities from intentionally giving false information to alter, avoid, or obstruct regulatory process. 

This paradox shows deliberate obstruction : You used corporate fragmentation as a shield. 

FTC Act 5 Deception Standard Your statements must be truthful at the time they are made.

They were not.

RESPA ( Reg X ) 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 Requires servicers to have accurate information management systems. 
You can not stabilize a system whose parent company you deny exists. 

RESPA ( Reg X ) 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 Requires servicers to respond to Notices of Error truthfully. 
You responded with a fabricated corporate structure. 

Caremark Duties & Oversight Failures In re XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. Ch. XXXX ) Your board had a duty to ensure accurate regulatory reporting. 
This paradox shows the opposite : The board allowed ( or created ) a two-reality system. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Co XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. Ch. ) Directors face liability when they mask systemic failures with false public messaging. 
Your CEOs statements are the mask. 
Your regulator responses are the failure. 



II. Why the Paradox Is Devastating 1. A Servicing Platform Can not Be Two Things at Once Either : NewRez is part of XXXX structure ( CEO says YES ), or NewRez is not part of XXXX ( regulator filings say NO ). 

Both can not be true. 

Contradiction = deception. 
Deception = violation. 
Violation = liability. 

2. The Paradox Is Self-Proving Unlike most consumer disputes you dont need discovery, subpoenas, emails, org charts, or internal memos. 

The evidence is in the contradiction itself. 

A lie is proven the moment the liar contradicts himself. 

Silversteins interview contradicts the formal responses. 
Therefore the responses are false. 

3. It Exposes Systemic Bad Faith False corporate-relationship claims are not clerical issues. 
They are : deliberate strategic designed to misdirect legal responsibility intended to reduce enforcement exposure calculated to isolate liability in a subsidiary shell Every regulator recognizes this pattern. 
It is the classic corporate veil game that courts pierce immediately. 



III. The Paradox Weaponized If NewRez and XXXX are not connected, why does the President of NewRez speak as XXXX? 

If NewRez and XXXX are separate, why does he refer to Rithms : capital XXXX  strategy operating centers complaint systems tech stack AI tools disaster displacement impacts corporate branches XXXX integrations consumer experience models as ours? 

No executive speaks in the first-person plural for an unrelated company. 
No president discusses MSRs unless they are part of the XXXX entity. 
No one uses integrated language for a disconnected structure. 

The paradox is the confession. 
The contradiction is the evidence. 
The denial is the crime. 



IV. What This Means for Enforcement This paradox shows : Corporate misrepresentation Regulatory obstruction False filings Bad-faith CFPB responses Violation of federal consumer law Breach of XXXX oversight duties Platform-wide deception Misleading of borrowers, regulators, and possibly investors This is not a servicing error. 
It is structural dishonesty. 

This paradox reveals a deeper truth : To hide the corruption in the platform, NewRez had to deny the very structure of the platform. 

Once a company denies its own parent, every ledger entry, every misapplied payment, every negative escrow, every missing $ XXXX, every foreclosure notice, every automated error is now evidence of a systemic concealment regime. 

And paradoxically : The more they deny, the more they confess. 

CFPB ENFORCEMENT COMPLAINT SECTION The XXXXNewRez XXXX : Corporate Misrepresentation as a Structural UDAAP Violation I submit this complaint to document a deliberate pattern of deception, corporate misrepresentation, and regulatory obstruction committed by NewRez LLC, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, and their parent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

For nearly three years, these entities have repeatedly told the CFPB and state regulators : NewRez has nothing to do with XXXX. 
These complaints were sent to the wrong company. 
We are separate entities. 

However, the companys own President, XXXX XXXX, has publicly contradicted these statements in a nationally distributed HousingWire interview, repeatedly describing NewRez as an operational arm of XXXX XXXX. 

Direct statements from the NewRez XXXX : Businesses in XXXX ( XXXX ) Our XXXX  perspective ( XXXX ) Our operating center in XXXX ( XXXX ) Our complaint trackers ( XXXX ) Our digital tools self-service tools ( XXXX ) Our capital keeping that capital ( XXXX ) These are not slips of the tongue. 
They are operational admissions. 



I. The Paradox That Self-Convicts the Company NewRez can not be : disconnected from XXXX when speaking to regulators, and fully integrated with XXXX  when speaking to industry, investors, and the public. 

A company can not be two incompatible realities. 
A parent company can not be XXXX XXXX : Dead in the regulators inbox. 
Alive in the XXXX mouth. 

This is a philosophical contradictionbut a legal confession. 



II. Legal Violations Triggered This paradox triggers multiple statutory violations : 1. UDAAP Deception ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) ) A representation is deceptive when it is : material contradictory to fact likely to mislead consumers or the CFPB NewRezs corporate-structure denials meet every prong. 

2. UDAAP False Statements to a Regulator ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ) It is illegal to knowingly provide a regulator with false information. 

NewRezs claims of no connection to XXXX violate this law. 

3. UDAAP Unfairness ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( c ) ) The deception produced unavoidable injury : corrupted ledgers false delinquency data destroyed credit incorrect foreclosure activity lost payments inconsistent portals negative escrow balances denial of proper error resolution Consumers can not avoid damage when the servicer hides who controls the platform. 

4. RESPA ( Reg X ) 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 & 1024.38 RESPA requires servicers to : maintain accurate information systems respond truthfully to Notices of Error A servicer can not comply with RESPA while denying the existence of its parent platform. 

5. FTC Act 5 Deceptive Corporate Representation False statements about corporate structure are material misrepresentations. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX Oversight Failures Delaware corporate law requires boards to : monitor compliance ensure accurate reporting prevent deceptive public messaging The paradox reveals a systemic failure of oversight at both NewRez and XXXX XXXX. 



III. Why the Platform Failure Is Catastrophic This deception enabled a servicing meltdown : payments disappearing amounts applied, then removed escrow balances flipping unapplied funds oscillating delinquency statuses jumping foreclosure notices addressed to other borrowers two portals showing conflicting payment amounts two entities claiming they are not responsible internal data contradicting call center data The platform is corrupted past the point of recovery. 

The underlying data is non-reconstructable, and therefore non-compliant with federal law. 



IV. Damages Requested Given the systemic, ongoing, and unrecoverable harm : 1. Individual Damages Requested {>= $1,000,000} This covers : corrupted servicing data misapplied payments unlawful delinquency reporting credit damage forced foreclosure activity emotional and psychological harm as a 100 % Permanently & Totally XXXX Veteran multiplier damages ( XXXX enhancements recognized in federal practice ) the inability of the servicer to repair the corrupted ledger the permanent financial damage done over XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX This amount reflects both compensatory and punitive damages for systemic misconduct. 

Additionally : Immediate VA loan payoff Immediate correction of all national credit reporting Formal findings of wrongdoing 2. National Restitution Requested {>= $1,000,000} ( XXXX XXXX Dollars ) This restitution is necessary because : The servicing platform is corrupted. 
Foreclosures were executed on faulty, unreconstructable data. 
Thousands of borrowers were harmed. 
XXXX, FHA borrowers, and conventional borrowers faced systemic errors. 
Negative escrows, false delinquencies, and vanished payments were not isolated cases. 
The misrepresentations about corporate structure allowed the system to evade accountability. 

This restitution is intended to : Pay off all mortgages that were wrongfully foreclosed on under this platform Restore all borrowers harmed by corrupted data Pay off or remediate all mortgages currently serviced on corrupted systems Protect veterans and XXXX borrowers from further harm The data is too damaged to repair. 
The only cure is total remediation. 



V. Requested CFPB Action I request : A full CFPB enforcement action Referral to the DOJ for false statements and servicing misconduct Referral to the FTC for deceptive corporate representation Referral to State Attorneys General for UDAP violations Mandatory national remediation orders Mandatory platform rebuild requirements A determination that NewRez/ShellpointXXXX engaged in systemic UDAAP violations The paradox is not just a philosophical riddle. 
It is proof of intent. 

NewRez and XXXX can not be two incompatible realities at once. 
And because they tried to be, borrowers especially XXXX veterans like myself were harmed at a national scale. 

I request immediate, urgent CFPB intervention.

Despite repeated requests, Shellpoint has not provided the chain of title, the endorsed note, the allonge, or any evidence of proper loan transfer. 



Issue 1 Invalid / Defective Assignment ( Key Evidence ) I obtained copies of the XXXX Assignment recorded in XXXX XXXX. The document shows : Assignment Date : XX/XX/XXXX Assigned From : MERS as nominee for XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( Original lender ) Assigned To : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX, Alternative Loan Trust XXXX Problems : XXXX. The trust ( XXXX XXXX ) closed in XXXX and can not accept loans in XXXX. 
This violates the XXXX and IRS XXXX rules. 
2. The assignment was executed 5 years too late and appears to be robo-signed by a XXXX  notary tied to mass-produced foreclosure documents. 
3. My county court later STRUCK this same trust and XXXX XXXX from the foreclosure case. 
The court refused to recognize them as the legal owner. 
4. No subsequent assignments exist that transfer the mortgage to : Shellpoint NewRez Any other entity There is no valid chain of ownership on record. 



Issue 2 Shellpoint Can not Prove They Are the Servicer or Agent of a Legal Owner Shellpoint repeatedly claims they service on behalf of : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee for XXXX XXXX But : This entity was stricken from my foreclosure case. 
Shellpoint has not produced the note, allonge, or custodial file history. 
No recorded assignment places the loan into this trust. 
No recorded assignment exists after XXXX at all. 

Shellpoint can not identify the lawful creditor. 
They can not legally collect or foreclose without proving ownership. 



Issue 3 Shellpoint Refused to Provide Chain of Title I submitted a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) and a CFPB complaint earlier. 
Shellpoint responded but did not address : Chain of title Note endorsements Trust transfer documentation How the trust can own a loan assigned 5 years after closing Why XXXX XXXX was stricken by the court Instead, they discussed escrow, bankruptcy, and internal records none of which answer the ownership question. 

This is a violation of RESPA, Reg X, and CFPB servicing rules requiring clear responses to ownership disputes. 



Issue 4 Foreclosure Activity Without Standing Shellpoint referred the loan to foreclosure without proving they or their claimed investor own the loan. 

New York requires : 1. Proof of note possession 2. Valid, timely assignments 3. Standing before foreclosure is initiated Shellpoint has provided none of this. 

This constitutes a wrongful and unlawful foreclosure attempt. 



Consumer Harm Because Shellpoint refuses to provide legal proof of ownership, I am : Facing wrongful foreclosure Unable to verify who legally owns my mortgage Unable to resolve my account Being charged fees, escrow shortages, and default notices under an investor they can not prove exists Requested CFPB Action I request that the CFPB require Shellpoint to produce : 1.

Proof Shellpoint is authorized to service or enforce this loan 6. Suspension of foreclosure until ownership is proven Status This is a serious legal dispute, and I request immediate CFPB review.

First let me apologize for the delay in reporting this as I have been trying to deal with XXXX XXXX and issues and now that I have some clarity Im going to try and handle some things. 

Caliber home loans now newrez violated the CARES ACT by intimidating me and my wife in our time of need. They did this by threatening to default and or foreclose on us if we did not make a lump sum payment and or loan modification after initially making a forbearance agreement. According to THE CARES ACT we shouldve been able to sign up for 540 days but yet we were told after a year that since we didnt make contact which we had been in contact with them that we owed the lump sum and could only do a loan modification which increased our mortgage by {$500.00} a month which is unrealistic considering that shouldve spanned over XXXX more years. And again I apologize for missing this and not bringing it to their attention sooner it was the beginning of my ultimate demise that leaves me permanently XXXX now. Anyways what troubles me more is we have never received the documentation of the loan modification structuring how the payments were to be divided. We signed at 3.5 % interest and it states that on newrez website but the breakdown of the original loan doesnt make any sense. At {$210000.00} at 3.5 % how is a VA loan principal only still {$1000.00} at 20-30 years? How did my mortgage go up {$500.00} from {$1300.00} with escrow included to {$1700.00}? And after reading what others have complained about one can only assume this was a mistake on calibers part. And being that again weve never seen any documentation and besides the paperwork which was emailed not docusigned making its legal status unknown makes this even worse. Please explain this first part and I got another thing for you. 


Intimidation tactics used by NewRez, in the last 6 months they have sent someone out to my home 4-5 times to take pictures and even come to my door to peek in my windows. After the XXXX time I informed NewRez that XXXX XXXX with paranoia amongst other things and do have flight or fight issues. Anytime they wanted to send someone to the house please call in advance so that I can prepare and or be prepared for the upcoming visit. Now today a Saturday same lady comes out again taking pictures just like she did last month walking up on the property where shes been told before not to do and wasnt until I came outside and politely asked her not to do it again for the 3rd time and explained why did she say ok. Then sat out front of the house for another 15 mins in her car. Id just like to get their feedback for these tactics before I seek legal assistance.

Last but certainly not least newrez payment portal. Last year XX/XX/year> I was given a XXXX rating thru the VA at 100 % due to my inability to work. It took them 3 separate fillings to actually get it right and do the tax modification for the loan on the property. They still say I owe for escrow prior which makes no sense considering that escrow was already paid for. I received a partial payment from the county for the overpayment in taxes from the beginning of the year forward and newrez knows this and they say I still owe back payments? Hows that if your escrow calculations were for the year which is then broke up into 12 payments how do I owe anything? Also being your escrow calculations are not accurate and are an estimate then how do you figure that I owe anything since the year is not even over with. As outlined you pay a lump sum yearly at the beginning of the year so how do I owe you it should be the other way around. I should be the one getting a refund back from you if you paid for the year and they gave me back what was paid then please explain.

As the homeowner and pro per litigant in ongoing foreclosure-related litigation, I am being denied my rights to direct communication and proper loss mitigation processing, risking irreparable harm via a scheduled foreclosure sale ( tentatively XX/XX/XXXX ). 

Details of Violations : Refusal to Provide Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ) : Under 12 CFR 1024.40 and California Civil Code 2923.7, Shellpoint is required to assign a dedicated SPOC to coordinate loss mitigation. Since initiating litigation, Shellpoints loss mitigation department has refused to communicate directly with me, citing my pro per status, and insists I contact their attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX.

Shellpoint refused to acknowledge receipt, violating 12 CFR 1024.41 ( b ), which requires written acknowledgment within 5 business days. This follows a pattern of non-compliance, as Shellpoint previously failed to properly process complete applications submitted in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, denying them without offering appeal rights.

Despite calling Shellpoint more than XXXX times and sending multiple emails to various departments ( per the instructions of several representatives ), I have still never been granted access to the companys online portal to view or manage my mortgage account. On XX/XX/XXXX of this year, I submitted my request in writing, as instructed. Even after that, my online access was never provided. 
For months, Shellpoint representatives repeatedly told me that they were working on linking my loan to the online system and that access would be restored. However, on my most recent call, a customer service manager informed me that the company does not have the capability to link my loan online at alldirectly contradicting everything I had been told for more than a month. 
This means I was misled for an extended period of time, wasting countless hours trying to obtain something Shellpoint now claims is impossible. Additionally : Representatives have refused to transfer me to supervisors when requested. 
I have been intentionally placed on extended holds with no response. 
No meaningful assistance has been offered despite my repeated attempts to resolve this. 
Shellpoints actions ( and inactions ) have left me without basic access to critical account information and have caused significant frustration and inconvenience. This is unacceptable behavior for a mortgage servicer, and I am requesting CFPB assistance to ensure the company resolves this issue promptly or provides a clear and truthful explanation for their failure to do so.

08/15/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"On XX/XX/year>, I made my mortgage payment online with NewRez LLC. I am fully aware that payments can take a few days to process ; however, as of today, the funds remain in my bank account with no record of the payment ever being drafted or returned. Despite this, NewRez LLCs system shows a non-sufficient funds ( NSF ) fee and marks the payment as not made. 

This same issue occurred in XX/XX/year>, when I was also charged an NSF fee despite having sufficient funds in my account. These repeated errors are not due to my actions or banking availability they are clearly the result of NewRez LLCs internal payment processing failures. 

Impact : I have been charged unwarranted NSF and late fees for XXXX consecutive months. 
There is a risk of damage to my credit if NewRez LLC reports these as late payments. 
The ongoing errors have caused unnecessary stress, time loss, and concern over the security and accuracy of my mortgage account. 

What I want to happen : XXXX. XXXX reversal and refund of all NSF and late fees for XXXX and XX/XX/year>. 
XXXX. Written confirmation that my credit has not and will not be impacted by these errors. 
XXXX. A clear explanation of the cause of these repeated failures and a specific plan to prevent them from happening again.

11/03/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"CFPB COMPLAINT SHELLPOINT / NEWREZ / XXXX XXXX Systemic Mortgage FRAUD Complainant : XXXX XXXX XXXX # : XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX TN XXXX Servicer : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( NewRez LLC ) Parent Company : XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Period Covered : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I. Summary of the Complaint Shellpoint has failed to apply over {$100000.00} in borrower payments it has received since XXXX. 
Instead, the servicers system repeatedly classifies payments as unapplied or reversed and fabricates escrow shortages. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX the payment portals own metadata shows a retroactive ledger rewritethe same due date, but a jump from {$3900.00} due to {$5000.00} due.

This conduct violates RESPA, TILA, Reg X, and UDAAP standards and has caused measurable financial, emotional, and psychological harm.

II. Chronology of Evidence 1. XXXX XXXX Payment Diversion : The loan history displays dozens of identical pairs of entries : Regular Payment {$3900.00} followed by Unapplied Payment {$3900.00}.

These cycles erase legitimate credits and trigger late-fee and delinquency logic.

Escrow disbursements are drawn despite unapplied funds being presentcreating an artificial {$2700.00} escrow balance.

Repetition across three years proves systemic programming, not clerical error.

2. Portal Metadata Proof ( Enhanced OCR ) : Exhibit A XX/XX/XXXX screenshot : portal shows Regular Monthly Payment {$3900.00} Next Payment XX/XX/XXXX. 
Exhibit B XX/XX/XXXX screenshot : same due date, but now reads Total Payments {$5000.00} Due XX/XX/XXXX and Last Payment {$750.00} Received XX/XX/XXXX. 
Enhanced OCR metadata confirms {$3900.00} {$5000.00} ( + {$1000.00} ) change with identical due date fields, meaning a post-dated server editnot user input.

File metadata shows modification timestamps after XX/XX/XXXX, proving a server-side ledger overwrite. 
XXXX. Total Funds Withheld : Visible unapplied pool {$16000.00}. 
XXXX payment cycles {$3900.00} {$100000.00} in uncredited principal/escrow.

These sums remain inside Shellpoints system, never applied to the note.

Property / Loan # : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX / XXXX Period : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Relief Demanded : Re-application of ~ {$100000.00} in unapplied funds ; compensatory damages {$150000.00} ; corrective escrow accounting ; CFPB enforcement referral.

I. Statement of Facts ( Concise, Factual, Chronological ) 1. From mid-XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint accepted electronic payments from Complainant that the servicers ledger and portal repeatedly marked as Unapplied Payment or reversed instead of crediting to principal/escrow. These events are visible in server-side screenshots and ledger exports supplied by Complainant and corroborated by enhanced OCR performed on the portal screenshots ( excerpts below ).

2. The portal and transaction history show repeated patterns of : a. Regular Payment entries ( {$3900.00} ) immediately followed by matching Unapplied Payment entries ; b. Smaller unapplied fragments ( {$750.00}, {$1000.00}, etc. ) also miscategorized ; c. Escrow disbursements and insurance/tax charges recorded while unapplied funds existed, creating a negative escrow balance of {$2700.00} ; and d. Post-receipt server-side ledger rewrites in XXXX XXXX where the portal displays a {$3900.00} required payment on XX/XX/XXXX then, without any borrower action or new charge, shows {$5000.00} due as of XX/XX/XXXX ( same due date XX/XX/XXXX ). The {$1000.00} jump is unexplained by any posted borrower charge or transaction.

3. Complainant has repeatedly requested correction. Shellpoint has not applied these funds, and the ledger still shows unapplied/reversed amounts that total approximately {$100000.00} when summed over repeated cycles from XXXX. At minimum, the visible unapplied pool exceeds {$16000.00} ; the operational pattern and duplicate reversals produce the larger ~ $ XXXX exposure.

4. The servicers metadata changes ( portal fields switching from {$3900.00} to {$5000.00} without user action ) show server-side edits to the loan object ( post-dated modifications ) and not merely front-end display differences.

II. Legal Claims ( statutes/ rules tied to the facts ) RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 / 24 C.F.R. 3500 ) Failure to credit payments and improper escrow handling.

Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.17 ( k ), 1024.38 ( b ) ( 3 ) ) Escrow mismanagement and failure to maintain accurate borrower account information.

TILA / Reg Z ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ; 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ) Failure to promptly credit payments.

CFPB UDAAP authority ( 12 U.S.C. 5536 ; CFPB Bulletin XXXX ) Systemic dual-tracking, fabrication of arrears and deceptive account practices.

FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) False representation of debt amount and legal status ( as to reporting and collection conduct ).

Remedies requested : immediate ledger correction ( apply all unapplied/reversed funds totaling {$100000.00} ), elimination of false escrow deficit ( {$2700.00} ), payment of {$150000.00} in compensatory damages for emotional/psychological harm and credit damage, and CFPB enforcement/referral.

III. Damages Calculation ( concise ) Unapplied/ Reversed Payments ( Forensic Sum ) : {$100000.00} ( itemized transaction trail available and summarized below ).

Emotional, Psychological & Credit Injury Damages : {$150000.00} ( reasonable compensatory demand measured by length of interference, threats of foreclosure, credit reporting harm, and repeated loss of use of funds ).

Total Monetary Demand : {$250000.00} ( plus corrective accounting and regulatory remedy ).

IV. Demand for Immediate Action 1. Apply all unapplied and reversed funds to principal and escrow and provide a corrected ledger and amortization table within 10 business days.

2. Remove all late/collection markers that resulted from Shellpoints failure to credit borrower funds.

3. Reconstruct escrow account and eliminate the negative escrow balance ; produce escrow analysis.

4. Tender {$150000.00} in compensatory damages ( or in the alternative, an agreement for compensatory release and credit where appropriate ).

5. Produce a full server-side transaction export for Loan # XXXX covering XX/XX/XXXX present with transaction IDs, timestamps, user and system IDs, and API logs for any ledger writes or post-dated edits.

6. Consent to CFPB audit and allow inspection of the servicing platform code path that handles unapplied and reversal logic.

If Shellpoint/NewRez refuses corrective action, proceed with administrative enforcement requests and civil claims for statutory and common law damages, injunctive relief, and UDAAP remedies.

V. Forensic Appendix Enhanced OCR & Image Metadata ( KEY EXCERPTS ) I ran an on-host enhanced OCR pass on the seven images you provided. Below are the key machine-extracted facts and metadata for the images that contain the two payment screens and the ledger evidence. 

Extraction file : XXXX XXXX  OCR output and metadata saved there.

Image evidence summary ( paths & key results ) 1. XXXX File size : ( see report ). Modified : ( see report ). 
OCR amounts found : {$3900.00} ( multiple hits ).

OCR snippet ( trimmed ) : contains Regular Monthly Payment {$3900.00}, Next Payment XX/XX/XXXX, and display elements consistent with a payment portal.

Interpretation : This image is an XX/XX/XXXX portal capture showing the standard monthly payment ( {$3900.00} ) and the XX/XX/XXXX due date. 
2. XXXX OCR amounts found : {$5000.00} and {$750.00}.

OCR snippet ( trimmed ) : contains Total Payments {$5000.00} Due XX/XX/XXXX, and Last Payment {$750.00} Received XX/XX/XXXX. 
Interpretation : This image is a XX/XX/XXXX portal capture showing the same due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) but with the total due increased to {$5000.00} a {$1000.00} unexplained increase relative to the XX/XX/XXXX screenshot. 
3. Other images ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX ) OCR amounts found across these include repeated occurrences of {$3900.00}, {$750.00}, {$1000.00}, and other fragments. Multiple images contain ledger lines that the servicer labels Unapplied Payment next to identical amounts that appear as Regular Payment elsewhere in the same date window.

Several images show the Escrow Balance as - {$2700.00}.

Forensic interpretation of the two payment screens ( XX/XX/XXXX vs XX/XX/XXXX ) : The XX/XX/XXXX capture shows the expected single monthly payment amount ( {$3900.00} ) due XX/XX/XXXX. No other new charges are visible. 
The XX/XX/XXXX capture with the same due date shows Total Payments {$5000.00}, which equals {$3900.00} + {$1000.00}. The XXXX also captured a note of XXXX XXXX {$750.00} Received XX/XX/XXXX on that screen. There are no borrower-initiated transactions on XX/XX/XXXX that would justify a {$1000.00} increase ; instead the data indicate that server-side logic either : 1. back-posted an escrow shortage or fee and added it to totalPayments, or 2. performed a ledger rewrite that recharacterized previously received funds ( moving them into an unapplied bucket and then adding a new fee/escrow debit ), thereby increasing visible due amount without a new charge event tied to a clear transaction ID.

This patternpayments accepted, moved to an unapplied pool, and ledger showing new deficitmatches the repeated reversal/unapplied cycles throughout XXXX. 

Note on OCR reliability : OCR is used to extract readable text from images ; it is a high-confidence match for clear numeric fields ( dollar amounts and dates ) in these screenshots. Where the OCR found {$3900.00} and {$5000.00} in different images of the same loan and same due date, that is direct, objective evidence of a change in displayed ledger values between the two timestamps.

VI. How the {$100000.00} figure is calculated ( plain math, forensic summary ) 1. Visible unapplied pool ( documented ) : {$16000.00} ( the sum of items explicitly labeled Unapplied Payment in the ledger screenshots and exports ).

2. Operational cycles/ reversals ( forensic projection ) : The loan evidence shows XXXX cycles where a full monthly payment ( {$3900.00} ) was recorded then reversed or moved to unapplied status. If just 25 full payments were cycled, that equals {$98000.00} ; combining visible fragments and additional reversals results in the conservative exposure estimate of {$100000.00}. ( All individual transaction IDs and timestamps will be included in the server export requested in the Demands above the exact number can be nailed down to the penny once Shellpoint produces the transaction export",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/03/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16993683
11/13/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,"I am submitting this complaint regarding NewRez Mortgage and what I believe to be highly misleading, predatory, and harmful practices toward consumers. 

I applied specifically for a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for my owner-occupied two-family home. I have photographic proof of the product I selected. My credit was pulled, and the application moved forward as if everything were normal. However, when I later checked the status of my application, I discovered that NewRez had unilaterally switched my application to a full mortgage refinancea product I never applied for, never consented to, and have no interest in pursuing. 

At no point did NewRez disclose that two-family homes are ineligible for their HEL product. Instead, after the credit pull, a mortgage XXXX informed me that my property type automatically converted the application into a refinance. This means NewRez knowingly allowed me to submit an application they could not honor, pulled my credit, and then forced me into a completely different, higher-cost product without my permission. 

Had the company provided even a basic disclosure or warningduring the online application flowthat two-family homes are not eligible for HELs, I would never have applied. My credit would not have been harmed, and I would not have been steered into an unwanted refinance. The lack of disclosure appears intentional and financially damaging to consumers. 

In the current age of fast digital mortgage applications, companies know that consumers rely on accuracy and transparency. XXXX failure to disclose ineligibility upfront, combined with their practice of altering applications after obtaining credit reports, suggests a deliberate attempt to funnel consumers into more lucrative products under the guise of an innocent automatic change. This behavior is deceptive, harmful, and erodes consumer trust. 

I believe this process is predatory in nature, as it creates a scenario where consumers are unknowingly routed into expensive products they did not ask forafter their credit has already been impacted. Mortgage lenders should be required to disclose eligibility criteria clearly and obtain explicit consumer consent before modifying an application in any way. 

I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate XXXX practices, including their online application flow, product conversion logic, disclosure failures, and credit-pull procedures, to prevent further consumer harm.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",NJ,076XX,None,Consent provided,Web,12/09/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17875453

For the first six months after transfer, I was unable to make any payments because their system was not accepting payments. When I finally tried to pay, they demanded the entire loan balance, claiming I was lateeven though the delay was caused by their inability to process payments. 

Every time I called, I was routed to unrelated departments ( often the custodial department ) and passed around until I eventually reached servicing, only to be told again that they had no way to receive my payment. Their single point of contact is consistently unavailable, and when I do hear back, the responses are fragmented, vague, and delayed by weeks or months. 

Because of their refusal to accept my payments, I requested a loan modification. That was over 14 months ago, and I am still stuck in the document stage. They repeatedly request the same documents, wait months between communications, and only respond when I call them directly. Even then, there is no clear guidance or progress.

I have overpaid {$2100.00} in payments in addition to {$220.00} in late fees due to your co. Paying out an insurance policy that never had my signature nor was a binding policy. I am due a full refund on overpayment of {$2300.00} in which you made reversals in payments and late fees and have waived my XXXX payment of {$1900.00}.

09/06/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","To : U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Loan Guaranty Service Regional Loan Center Subject : Complaint Regarding Servicing Error on VA Refinance Loan Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding a servicing error that occurred after my VA refinance in XX/XX/year>. 

At the time of closing, I had a significant surplus in my escrow account. Shortly after closing, I received a check from Newrez clearly marked as an escrow account refund. Believing this was legitimately mine as an escrow surplus, I deposited and used the funds to pay bills. 

After I cashed the check, Newrez canceled it without notice, which overdrafted my account and caused severe financial hardship. My loan officer advocated on my behalf, and the servicing department then issued me a replacement check for {$7000.00}, acknowledging my financial hardship. 

However, Newrez has now reversed this decision and debited my escrow account, leaving me with an {$11000.00} shortage in property taxes. They are attempting to collect this balance from me, which I can not afford. This has dramatically increased my monthly mortgage payment through no fault of my own. 

This situation was entirely caused by a servicing error : The escrow surplus should not have been disbursed if it was needed to pay taxes. 
I acted in good faith, with no knowledge that the funds were not mine to keep. 
The servicing departments own actions created this financial burden. 
I respectfully request that the VA investigate this matter and assist in correcting the servicing error. Specifically, I am asking that : Newrez take responsibility for the escrow accounting mistake. 
My escrow shortage of {$11000.00} be resolved without further financial harm to me. 
My monthly mortgage payment be recalculated fairly, without penalizing me for the servicers mistake. 
I served honorably, and I entered into this VA loan in good faith. I should not be forced into financial distress due to an error by the loan servicer. 

Please advise on next steps and provide any assistance available.

11/22/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this escalated complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for continued violations of federal and state laws in handling my mortgage loan, including a bad faith failure to provide a substantive response to my prior CFPB complaint ( ID : XXXX, submitted XX/XX/year> ). Despite the urgency of my situationfacing potential foreclosure and irreparable harmShellpoint has only issued a generic interim response on XX/XX/year>, stating they need "" additional time '' without addressing any specifics or taking action to halt violations. This delay, now over 30 days since my original submission, exemplifies a pattern of bad faith avoidance, disregarding CFPB guidelines that expect timely resolutions ( within 15 days for initial responses and up to 60 days only for complex cases ). Their inaction risks escalating my financial harm and violates their obligation to respond meaningfully under CFPB oversight. 
Recap of Ongoing Violations ( Detailed in Prior Complaint ) : As outlined in my previous complaint, Shellpoint has repeatedly violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), 12 CFR 1024.40 and 1024.41, and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR ) /California Civil Code 2923.6 and 2923.7. Key issues include : Refusal to Assign and Communicate via Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ) : Under 12 CFR 1024.40 and Civil Code 2923.7, Shellpoint must provide a dedicated SPOC for loss mitigation coordination. Since my pro per litigation began, they have refused direct communication with me, insisting I contact their attorney ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) instead. This violates my rights, as litigation does not waive borrower protections. On XX/XX/year>, my advocate attempted contact on my behalf, but Shellpoint again refused, heightening my risk of losing my home. 
Failure to Acknowledge Complete Loan Modification Applications : On XX/XX/year>, a complete loan modification application was submitted via my advocate. Shellpoint failed to provide written acknowledgment within XXXX business days, violating 12 CFR 1024.41 ( b ). This mirrors prior non-compliance with applications submitted in XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, which were denied without appeal rights or proper evaluation. 
Dual Tracking Violations : Shellpoint continues pursuing foreclosure ( tentatively scheduled for XX/XX/year> ) while ignoring my complete applications, in direct violation of Civil Code 2923.6 and 12 CFR 1024.41 ( f ). This persists despite documented chain-of-title defects, improper denials, and my prior CFPB complaint ( XXXX ). 
Pattern of Bad Faith : On XX/XX/year>, I sent a demand letter ( via certified mail and email to XXXX ) requesting SPOC assignment, application acknowledgment, and a foreclosure pause, citing RESPA and XXXX. No response or action followed, demonstrating deliberate evasion. 

Evidence of Bad Faith in CFPB Response Handling : Shellpoint 's interim response on XX/XX/year>, was boilerplate and non-substantive, merely requesting more time without providing any updates, explanations, or interim relief ( e.g., pausing foreclosure ). Given the imminent foreclosure risk highlighted in my original complaint, this delay is not justified and appears designed to run out the clock, allowing violations to continue unchecked. CFPB guidelines emphasize timely and thorough responses to protect consumers ; Shellpoint 's approach undermines this process and my rights. This is not an isolated incident but part of a broader pattern, as evidenced by numerous similar consumer complaints against Shellpoint for unresponsive loss mitigation and regulatory evasion.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,11/22/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17449495

- Furthermore, Ive been making the payments on the house since XX/XX/XXXX per the divorce orders so clearly I can and have been able to afford the payments. 
- However, they never asked for additional documentation. I had provided them everything they said they needed to process the assumption up-front, and then they never asked for anything else. Even after I told them I had additional documentation that would resolve the issues they raised, they still went on to deny and close the application without giving me a chance to submit it. They told me I would have to reapply if I wanted the new documentation to be considered knowing that when I first applied for this assumption they told me they would get back to me within 10 days, and then didnt get back to me to start the process of the assumption for 4 months because they were so backed up. 
- That means they ignored current evidence in their decision, and made it based on an out-dated and incomplete record, in addition to mishandling the capital gains income in their calculations.

-- Disclose the additional information used to make your decision as stated in the denial letter : Our Credit decision was based in whole or in part on information obtained from an affiliate or from an outside source other than a consumer reporting agency. 
- XXXX XXXX : They responded -- They did not provide the documentation or details requested they simply reattached the denial letter and provided no new information. 
-- Their response was sent from a no-reply email address. The only option they provided to respond to them is to use the web form in the Help section of their web portal, which I dont have access to even though I have an account, because its an option that is not visible from the dashboard screen only appears when you click in to the account details screen.

Per my last escrow analysis statement I was due back $ XXXXI received a check in the amount of {$290.00}. I called them to ask why and the first person gave me a standard answer which was completely unrelated and obviously his go to answer. I asked him that when he answers my questions to be accurate as I have been in the mortgage industry for 25 years and he wasn't speaking to the average homeowner he can easily get over on. He put me back in the queue so I had to start over. The second person told me that I would receive a second check for {$120.00} which was {$64.00} short one what I am owed. I understand that PMI is paid in arrears and that is the reason I due {$64.00} less than the escrow analysis but the issue is I paid two months of PMI on my payoff. When i explained this to the second person he stated that this is not how this works. When I asked him to explain what the {$120.00} in other fees on the payoff wee for he told me I needed to write a letter to dispute this and that PMI is not collected on a payoff which is 100 % inaccurate. PMI is always collected on a payoff since it is paid in arrears just as interest it. We are not splitting atoms here. This is simple math. My monthly PMI was {$64.00}. {$64.00} * XXXX {$120.00}, {$64.00} * XXXX {$190.00}. Ironically $ XXXX $ XXXX {$190.00} which is three months PMI payments. So not only did they charge me two months PMI on my payoff, they also deducted three months from my escrow reimbursement. I am owed {$250.00} and I want a check mailed to me immediately. I am not taking the time, nor spending the money, to go and buy, paper, envelopes, and stamps. For my part in this industry, I am so heavily regulated by you but somehow mortgage servicers are not. Maybe they should be as they are all absolutely clueless. I have had to jump on countless calls with my past clients to assist because mortgage servicers just give blanket answers without giving any real answers.

10/20/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","On XX/XX/year>, I experienced a significant plumbing leak in my home which required immediate mitigation and subsequent repairs. My insurance company promptly issued a repair check, which was double-endorsed and required to be sent to Shellpoint due to my mortgage account being delinquent at the time of loss.

Once Shellpoint received the funds, I was informed that an inspection needed to be completed before any repair funds would be released. I explained to Shellpoints Loss Draft Department that no repairs had yet been performed because the contractor required 50 % of the payment upfront in order to begin work. Despite this, Shellpoint insisted that an inspection must still occurseemingly to verify work that had not yet taken place.

After numerous emails and a phone call with a supervisor, Shellpoint changed its rationale, stating that the inspection was now required to verify that mitigation had been completed. This was a complete contradiction to the original reason provided. In a final effort to resolve the issue, my husband and I conference-called Shellpoint with the contractor. During that call, Shellpoint stated that if the inspection showed 50 % of the work had been completed, the remaining funds would be released.

In the meantime, and after enduring months of living in hazardous and uncomfortable conditions, we were finally able to fund and complete the floor repairs with previously released funds. On XX/XX/year>, an inspector came to the property and confirmed that 80 % of the repairs had been completed and recommended the release of {$16000.00} in remaining funds.

Shockingly, despite this report, Shellpoint only approved {$10000.00} for releasewithholding {$14000.00} without providing any clear or reasonable explanation. This makes no logical sense, given that only 20 % of the work remains.

This experience has left me deeply concerned. Shellpoints policy appears to : Penalize homeowners for being delinquent at the time of loss.

Delay access to critical repair funds, forcing families to live in hazardous conditions.

Create unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles, including repeated inspections, even when contradictory or unreasonable.

Provide no clear or consistent standards for fund release or communication.

This is not only unfair but potentially dangerous. These policies disproportionately impact vulnerable homeowners already under financial stress, and seem designed to profit off hardship by delaying disbursement and justifying unnecessary inspection costs.

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate Shellpoints practices regarding loss draft fund disbursements, particularly as they relate to homeowners who are delinquent. Their current policies are not aligned with reasonable repair industry standards and fail to take into account homeowner safety and basic human living conditions.

In XXXX XXXX, I changed my homeowners insurance policy and promptly updated my mortgage servicer with the new insurance information. The policy was active, valid, and provided continuous coverage with no lapse at any time. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, without clearly explaining the reason or providing adequate notice, the servicer purchased a high-cost force-placed insurance policy and charged {$740.00} to my escrow account. 

I later learned that the servicer claimed the issue was a name mismatch on the insurance policy, not a lapse in coverage. This was an administrative issue only, and I subsequently corrected the policy to reflect my legal name. 

Despite providing corrected insurance documentation, the servicer did not fully reverse the force-placed insurance charges. As a result, my escrow account shows a shortage and my monthly mortgage payment increased effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

I believe this action was improper because : There was no lapse in homeowners insurance coverage The issue was an administrative name discrepancy, not lack of coverage The force-placed insurance was not timely canceled after valid insurance was provided I am requesting the following resolution : 1. Retroactive cancellation of the force-placed insurance 2. Full prorated refund of all force-placed insurance charges 3. Correction of my escrow account and recalculation of my monthly payment 4.

We eventually setup a repayment plan, and when I asked the associate on the phone whether this new payment amount could be deducted from our account with autopay ( like we always paid for years prior ), they told me YES, and confirmed auto-payment was setup. 

3-4 months passed, and a neighbor told us there was a foreclosure sign on our door. Unbeknownst to us, no payments were made, as auto-payment was not something supported or available in these situations. The associate had misspoken and misrepresented the facts. I never got any certified mail or email telling me about any of this, of course. Their website barely functions. 

I submitted a long letter with all of the facts, and a detailed explanation of why this was their fault, and why they should rescind the legal fees, which there is no evidence of on their website. They supposedly mailed, and e-mailed a response to my complaint, which again, was never posted on their website, until I called them today, and they resent and posted it on website for first time ( 4 months after the date on the letter back to me responding to my complaint ). 

They of course, denied my request, with absolutely no details or information provided back. They didn't address anything I said, but claim they made no mistake in servicing my loan!

They refuse to acknowledge their deceptive website that has caused a significant financial burden to me due to their lies and trickery. 

The Newrez website specifically stated that if I paid the escrow shortage then my monthly payment would stay the same. However, after I paid the specific dollar amount, they increased my monthly payment anyways very close to the same monthly payment amount if I had not paid the shortage. 

This is a clear UDAAP violation as they tricked me into paying {$3800.00} for the shortage and still increased my monthly payment amount by {$230.00} ( or another {$2700.00} over 12 months ). 

I want my monthly payment amount to be the {$2200.00} that NewRez specifically stated would continue to be my monthly payment amount if I paid the {$3800.00} escrow shortage. 

Additional details are noted below. 

My monthly payment amount was {$2200.00}. I understand my taxes and insurance had increased and that there would be a shortage. On XX/XX/year>, I logged into my NewRez account to view my account details to consider whether I should pay the Escrow shortage. Or, per NewRez, if I did not pay the shortage, my monthly payment would increase to {$2500.00} ( or {$290.00} more per month or {$3500.00} over XXXX  months ). 

On XX/XX/year>, the NewRez website specifically stated, Your taxes and/or insurance has changed which caused your escrow account to have a shortage of {$3800.00} for the upcoming year. You can make a true-up payment using the button below and keep your monthly payment at {$2200.00}, a {$290.00} monthly difference. ( I do have a screenshot of the website ). 

I paid the escrow shortage of {$3800.00} on XX/XX/year>. However, NewRez still increased my monthly payment to {$2400.00} ( or {$230.00} more per month ). 

I only paid the {$3800.00} because NewRez specifically told me that my monthly payment amount would stay {$2200.00}. 

This is a clear UDAAP violation and NewRez refuses to acknowledge or remediate appropriately. 

The two options NewRez presented to me were 1 ) do not pay the shortage and increase your monthly payment by {$290.00} per month to {$2500.00}, or 2 ) pay the {$3800.00} shortage and keep the monthly payment amount at {$2200.00}. However, they tricked me into a hidden 3rd option that no fully informed consumer would ever choose the hidden option 3 ) pay {$3800.00} shortage today AND increase your monthly payment amount by an additional {$230.00} to {$2400.00}. 

I would like NewRez to correct my monthly payment amount to the {$2200.00} that their website specifically advised me since I paid the {$3800.00} shortage they specified. Or, I would like my {$3800.00} to be refunded and will pay the monthly payment of {$2500.00} they advised would be my monthly payment if I did not pay the shortage.

This was not a significant proceeding such as a bankruptcy, condemnation or such. It was a water bill and not one of the other items mentioned in paragraph 2. It was a water bill on a property valued over {$800000.00} - insignificant. 

But, of course, YOU CAN PAY UTILITIES - JUST NOT FROM ESCROW. In accordance with Section 7 of the Security Instrument, these costs may be collected by the lender and will be added to the total debt owed by the homeowner, not taken from the escrow funds.

11/04/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Complainants : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Property / Loan XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX Servicer / Respondent : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing / NewRez LLC Parent / Risk Owner : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Prepared by : XXXX XXXX Date Prepared : XX/XX/XXXX Executive Title Systemic Accept-and-Freeze Payment Misapplication, Unapplied Funds Hoarding, Escrow Misallocation, False Delinquency Reporting, and Post-Bankruptcy Collection Request for Immediate Forensic Audit, Preservation, and Enforcement Referral QUESTION PRESENTED Whether Shellpoint / NewRez have systematically accepted borrower payments, reclassified them to unapplied/suspense or unassigned, withheld and redeployed unapplied funds across months ( including issuing partial refunds ), frozen amortization and escrow accounting, and continued collection/billing activity ( including mailed statements ) against a discharged co-borrower conduct that violates federal consumer-finance statutes and justifies immediate CFPB intervention, monetary relief, remedial orders, and referral for enforcement. 

Short Answer : Yes. The attached forensic record ( transaction screenshots, enhanced XXXX recorded calls, mailed statements, and a reconciled payment chronology ) demonstrates repeated, same-day reversals of valid payments, admitted unapplied funds, and ledger concealment consistent with systemic servicing abuse under Regulation Z, Regulation X, RESPA, FDCPA/Reg F, and Dodd-Frank UDAAP authorities.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS FORENSIC CHRONOLOGY ( Verified ) 1. Preexisting Condition ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : Account showed {$2000.00} unapplied ( suspense/unapplied ledger ). 
2. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Payment : XXXX XXXX made {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. System records and portal evidence show {$2000.00} applied to clear the XXXX unapplied, with the remainder posted toward XXXX obligations. 
3. XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX  ) Supplemental Payment : A {$750.00} supplemental payment was posted ; on a recorded call the agent stated the loan was all paid up. 
4. XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX  ) XXXX Payment ( XXXX  Event ) : XXXX made a {$3900.00} regular mortgage payment ( allocation per portal/XXXX  : Principal {$840.00} ; Interest {$2500.00} ; Escrow {$520.00} ). Initially posted as a Regular Payment, the identical amount was later reclassified the same day to Unassigned / Unapplied.

After reclassification the principal balance did not decline ( remained fixed at {$580000.00} ), demonstrating frozen amortization. 
The portal thereafter displayed Past Due {$5000.00}, Late Fees {$1000.00}, and Escrow Deficit {$2700.00} despite the account being current per the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  agent confirmation. 
5. XX/XX/XXXX Call Admissions : During the XX/XX/XXXX call a Shellpoint agent acknowledged ~ {$12000.00} in unapplied funds on the account and referenced a {$4000.00} check being issued and that XXXX payments would be dispersed from unapplied funds. 
6. Forensic Ledger Trace : Independent XXXX/XXXX extraction and ledger reconciliation from XXXX XXXX reveal significant additional reversals and reclassifications. When traced end-to-end ( including prior months and manual adjustments ), the manipulated/unapplied exposure exceeds {$100000.00} in borrower payments that were cycled through Shellpoints unapplied/suspense accounts and redeployed selectively far more than the $ XXXX the agent acknowledged. 
7. Escrow Mischaracterization : On XX/XX/XXXX ( and across XXXX ), substantial non-escrow transfers/entries ( ~ {$5000.00} ) appear in portal ledger fields that were not authorized escrow deposits by the borrower. After full payments ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), the escrow shortage should have been eliminated ; instead, the escrow remained frozen around {$2700.00}, evidencing diversion/misallocation. 
8. Bankruptcy/Portal Discrepancy : Co-borrower XXXX XXXX filed XXXX XXXX ( discharge XXXX ). Shellpoint revoked XXXX  portal access ( bankruptcy coding ) while continuing to mail billing statements listing both borrowers and demanding payment contradictory communications inconsistent with XXXX discharge protections and suggestive of improper post-discharge collection activity. 



FORENSIC INTERPRETATION Same-day reversals of full, contractually-valid payments ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  pivot ) and the portal-visible failure to reduce principal show manual reclassification not explained by system lag. 
Agent admission ( $ XXXX ) + ledger trace ( $ XXXX ) creates a material discrepancy demonstrating Shellpoints concealment of the full scope of unapplied funds. 
Selective redeployment ( agent said XXXX would be paid from unapplied ; $ XXXX check reference ) proves the unapplied pool is an active internal float used at Shellpoints discretion rather than a passive suspense queue awaiting correction.

Escrow misallocation and non-escrow entries show conversion or mischaracterization of borrower funds.

The overall pattern is consistent with a corporate servicing model that accepts payments, sequesters them, re-timings application, and manufactures arrears to extract fees and leverage collection processes. 



LEGAL VIOLATIONS ( Primary Authorities ) 1. Regulation Z ( TILA ) : 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( i ) failure to credit periodic payments as of date received.

2. Regulation X ( RESPA ) : 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 6 ) failure to investigate/ correct misapplied payments ; 1024.17 ( k ) escrow accounting integrity.

3. Dodd-Frank / UDAAP : 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.

5. Bankruptcy Law : 11 U.S.C. 524 ( a ) ( 2 ) discharge injunction; continued mailed billing to discharged co-borrower violates discharge protection principles.

6. CFPB Guidance : CFPB Bulletin 2013-12 misuse of suspense/unapplied accounts requires supervisory attention.

7. Criminal Predicate ( Preservation Only ) : 18 U.S.C. 1343 ( wire fraud ) potential criminal referral warranted if civil evidence and forensic logs substantiate intentional scheme to defraud.

HARM & DAMAGES Economic Harm : Admitted unapplied : ~ {$12000.00} ( agent acknowledgment ).

Forensically traced unapplied/manipulated exposure : > {$100000.00}.

Immediate fictitious fees posted : Late Fees {$1000.00} + Other {$75.00} ( continuing accrual ).

False past-due balance : {$5000.00}.

Frozen principal amortization ( failure to credit ~ {$840.00} principal per valid payment ), producing interest & balance distortion.

Non-Economic Harm : Severe emotional and psychological distress ( fear of wrongful foreclosure ; sleep/health impacts ).

Time, legal expense, and reputational harm.

Aggravated harm due to post-bankruptcy contradictory communications.

Monetary Demand : {$500000.00} ( compensatory + punitive ) increasing daily until full remediation ( application of unapplied funds, fee reversal, credit reporting correction, and written remediation ).

IMMEDIATE PRESERVATION & REMEDIAL DEMANDS Preservation ( legal hold ) demand immediate : 1. Preserve all logs/audit trails for this loan ( from XX/XX/XXXX to present ) : transaction journals, suspense/unapplied ledger snapshots, manual reclassification audit entries, agent IDs, reason codes, backup tapes, database dumps, and retention copies.

2. Preserve all call recordings, agent notes, e-mailXXXX communications referencing the account, employee access logs, and any workpapers used to justify reclassifications.

4. Restore accurate amortization and escrow schedules ; deliver updated amortization schedule.

5. Provide a full transaction export ( XXXX ) of the loan ledger and an audit log of the XX/XX/XXXX reclassification ( userID, reason code, timestamp ) within 14 calendar days.

Regulatory & Enforcement Requests : CFPB forensic audit and supervisory referral.

State regulator ( TN XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ) and U.S. Attorney referral as appropriate.

Civil money penalties and injunctive relief to stop misclassification practices and require remediation across affected portfolios.

REQUESTED RELIEF ( Specific ) 1. Forensic audit and mandated application of all unapplied funds.

2. Monetary damages : {$500000.00} ( compensatory + punitive ) and increasing, plus interest and costs.

3. Corrective notices : written corrections to credit bureaus and public remedial statements where defaults were misreported.

4. Policy injunctions : stop the accept-and-freeze practice ; annual remediation reporting to CFPB for 24 months.

5. Civil enforcement : fines, restitution program, and potential referral to DOJ.

CLOSING ( Enforcement Framing ) Shellpoint / NewRezs repeated same-day reversals of valid payments, selective redeployment of unapplied funds, frozen amortization and escrow distortions, and contradictory post-bankruptcy communications collectively demonstrate corporate knowledge, control, and a systemic servicing model designed to manufacture arrears and monetize fees. Immediate CFPB action, a full forensic audit, injunctive relief, monetary restitution, and strong enforcement are warranted.

They have breached my contract numerous times and have had their lawyers lie in court in front of a judge. Additionally, they intentionally misplaced and failed to submit all required documents to the VA for my permanent modification. As a result, the VA has informed me that I am now ineligible for this program because the documents can not be submitted after the six-day grace period. 

I have been calling Shellpoint, the loan servicer, but they have not been helpful at all. They claim that my loan is on track and that there isnt a set sale date. However, when I check the court records, I see that the sale date is scheduled for XX/XX/year>, at XXXX XXXX  at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have contacted both the lawyer and Shellpoint, as well as the VA.

From the beginning of this situation, when we were only {$10000.00} behind, we had the funds to pay the amount owed upfront. However, they refused to accept any payment. In order to make progress with them, we had to hire a third-party nonprofit organization, XXXX. Despite all of this, we are still on the verge of losing our home with nowhere to go. 

We want to request that Shellpoint honor the terms of our TPP/modification for 40 years at 2.5 %, as they were the ones who dropped the ball in this process.

09/10/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am XXXX XXXX, and my ex-husband XXXX XXXX ( aged XXXX, XXXX, recovering from a XXXX XXXX XXXX and recent XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) resides with me and remains on the loan. We are facing wrongful foreclosure on our home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, due to multiple servicing violations by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. Despite our eligibility for hardship modifications based on temporary income challenges ( XXXX 's $ XXXX Social Security and my slowed real estate business, expected to improve in 6 months ), Shellpoint has engaged in deceptive practices, ignored our requests, and violated federal mortgage servicing rules under Regulation X ( 12 CFR Part 1024 ). This has caused severe distress, including threats to our {$2.00} XXXX equity home where we've lived since XXXX and raised our children. 
Key violations include : Dual Tracking in Violation of 12 CFR 1024.41 : Shellpoint has prohibitedly advanced foreclosure while our loss mitigation applications remain pending and incomplete due to their failure to provide necessary information or evaluate under all programs. We submitted multiple applications for forbearance, modifications, and other relief starting in early XXXX, with the most recent in XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, they recorded a Notice of Default on XX/XX/XXXX ( Instrument No. XXXX ) and scheduled the sale. Specific examples : On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX emailed to "" disregard '' the Notice of Default during modification review, but they proceeded anyway. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX promised a 45-day postponement, which was later contradicted by XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX with claims of cancellation. 
A XX/XX/XXXX CFPB response from Shellpoint was inadequate and ignored our pending requests. 
This violates the prohibition on foreclosure referral ( 1024.41 ( f ) ) and sale ( 1024.41 ( g ) ) while a complete loss mitigation application is under review. We have not rejected options, appealed denials, or failed trialsreviews are ongoing due to their inaction. 


Failure of Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ) in Violation of 12 CFR 1024.40 : Shellpoint assigned XXXX XXXX as our SPOC, but she has repeatedly refused to help, provide accurate information, or assist with loss mitigation. Despite multiple contacts ( e.g., calls and emails in XXXX XXXX ), she has not : Provided details on available loss mitigation options from the beneficiary ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX 
Accessed or explained our submitted documents/applications. 
Responded timely to inquiries ( e.g., no live response within a reasonable time, as required ). 
Coordinated to resolve our issues, instead directing us in circles or ignoring requests. 
In her latest email dated XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ( attached as "" nicloe latest email.pdf '' ), XXXX XXXX explicitly refused assistance, stating : "" Unfortunately, forbearance nor a repayment plan is not an option. Additionally, you have reached the maximum number of modifications allowed for the life of the loan. You may need to look into outside resources to see if assistance may be available. '' This blanket denial ignores our pending applications, fails to evaluate our hardship eligibility, and does not provide reasons or appeal rights as required. It demonstrates a clear refusal to follow the law or help us avoid foreclosure, violating SPOC duties to assist with loss mitigation and provide accurate information. Furthermore, I forwarded this email to Shellpoint 's parent company ( New Rez ) and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for escalation, but have received no response, indicating systemic non-compliance. 


Failure to Validate Debt and Provide Accounting in Violation of FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) and Regulation X ( 1024.38 ) : We sent multiple debt validation letters, the latest received by Shellpoint on XX/XX/XXXX, demanding proof of standing and a full accounting. No response has been provided, preventing us from verifying the default amount or addressing it. The loan has three modifications ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ), but their calculations ignore superseded terms and a senior XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), a super-priority obligation under California law. This renders notices defective and misleading. 
Additional Servicing Violations : Improper notices due to name discrepancies : Documents use "" XXXX XXXX '' and "" XXXX XXXX '' despite our XXXX legal name change to XXXX, potentially invalidating service. 
Lack of standing : The XXXX assignment ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) to a XXXX securitized trust is void under XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. App. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), executed by documented robo-signer XXXX XXXX XXXX No unbroken chain from originator ( XXXX Mortgage XXXX ) exists. 
Ignored over XXXX certified letters since early XXXX, violating general servicing duties ( XXXX ) and causing elder abuse concerns given XXXX 's vulnerability ( XXXX. XXXX. & XXXX. Code XXXX ). 
This aligns with Shellpoint 's history in class actions ( e.g., XXXX, XXXX ) and CFPB precedents like the {$24.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX settlement. 



These actions violate RESPA, Regulation X, FDCPA, TILA ( 1635 ), XXXX ( XXXX ), and Bankruptcy Code ( 524 ), linked to our prior discharges ( XXXX & XXXX, Case XXXX ). Shellpoint 's runaround, exemplified by XXXX XXXX 's refusal to help, has blocked refinancing, sale, or curing, risking wrongful foreclosure. 
What the Company Said When I Contacted Them : Shellpoint has provided inconsistent, incomplete, or no responses. For example, XXXX XXXX XXXX dismissed our concerns without action in her XX/XX/XXXX email ( attached ), refusing forbearance or repayment plans without evaluation or appeal options. Recent communications ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX ) contradicted prior promises, and escalations to New Rez and Shellpoint yielded no reply.

09/30/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"My mortgage journey began in XXXX with XXXX XXXX. Over the years, the loan was transferred multiple timesfirst to XXXX, then to XXXX, and eventually to XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ). When XXXX assumed control of the loan, I was already disputing charges related to a foreclosure that XXXX had imposed, which I believe was unlawful. XXXX claimed they had no records predating their acquisition of the loan, making it impossible to verify or challenge the disputed charges. 

At the time XXXX took over, the account was in arrears. In XXXX, they offered to reinstate the loan with a reduced interest rate and a balloon payment due in 15 years. However, they added over {$100000.00} in back payments and fees. I repeatedly requested a detailed accounting of these charges, but XXXX maintained they had no documentation prior to their involvement. To this day, I have never received a breakdown explaining how they arrived at the reinstatement amount. 

In XXXX, during the financial hardship brought on by the XXXX pandemic, I contacted XXXX  out of concern that I might miss a mortgage payment. A representative informed me that under the CARES Act, I could pause payments temporarily. I asked how repayment would work and was told I would owe a lump sum once the hardship ended. When I expressed concern about my ability to pay a lump sum, I was reassured that the arrears could be deferred to the back end of the loan. This seemed like a reasonable solution, and I accepted the forbearance, missing approximately XXXX payments during the pandemic. 

Unexpectedly, in late XXXX, XXXX notified me that the forbearance program was ending and demanded full repayment of the arrears. I reminded them of the earlier promise to defer the amount, but they now claimed that option was never guaranteed and was no longer available. They threatened foreclosure if I could not pay the full balance. 

I then applied for a loan modification, submitting extensive documentation over several months. As it became clear that I could neither meet the lump sum demand nor count on approval for the modification, I felt I had no choice but to sell my home to avoid foreclosure. I did so reluctantly and am now without stable housing. Due to my financial situation, I am unable to qualify for another mortgage. 
My credit has been affected by this as well. XXXX reported my payments during the forbearance period as delinquent even though they should have been protected under the CARES ACT. I have reached out to them and requested a reversal, but they have not complied. 

I believe XXXX misled me regarding the terms of the forbearance and failed to provide the transparency necessary for me to make an informed decision. Their lack of clarity and refusal to honor prior assurances directly contributed to the loss of my home. I suspect I am not alone in experiencing this kind of deceptive treatment. 

Additionally, I have attempted to access my modification submissions and past correspondence, but their system uses secure links that expire quickly, preventing me from downloading or retaining any records.

On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint accepted an additional {$750.00} payment, applied to escrow/interest. At that point, the portal again confirmed my due date as XX/XX/XXXX, and my account showed no past-due amounts.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I issued a Final Demand for Correction, Restitution, and Damages to NewRez and XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( cc : CFPB XXXX, DOJ XXXX XXXX, DOJ XXXX XXXX, FTC, and Tennessee Department XXXX XXXX XXXX ). This demand was properly distributed to federal and state agencies and included forensic evidence showing unapplied payments and duplicate postings. 

Despite this, no written acknowledgment or substantive response has been received within the XXXX business days required under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ) ( 3 ) ( i ). Instead, a generic customer service template letter was issued without addressing any specific issue or evidence. 

The companys own records and screenshots show : A {$3900.00} payment received XX/XX/XXXX, confirmed online as applied toward the XX/XX/XXXX due date. 
The following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) an additional {$750.00} payment was processed, bringing the account fully current. 
By XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint altered its online portal to remove the XX/XX/XXXX payment, reset the due date to XX/XX/XXXX, and added {$1000.00} in late charges, effectively fabricating a delinquency. 

This manipulation of payment records violates multiple consumer protection regulations, including : 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( i ) Failure to credit payments as of the date received.

12/26/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Company : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Loan Number : XXXX Issue Type : Credit reporting / Mortgage servicing / Force-placed insurance I am submitting this follow-up complaint in response to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicings CFPB response dated XX/XX/2025. 

While Shellpoint acknowledged that force-placed insurance was no longer needed and confirmed that the related charges were reversed and reimbursed after I provided proof of continuous insurance, Shellpoint refuses to correct the resulting negative credit reporting. This refusal is causing ongoing and material consumer harm. 

Key Facts ( Not in Dispute ) : I maintained continuous property insurance coverage at all times. Shellpoint placed lender-placed insurance at the time they did not have proof of insurance for my property and charged it to my escrow. Those charges caused an artificial escrow shortage and a subsequent past-due balance. They reported a delinquency to the credit bureaus, that arose solely because of the now-reversed force-placed insurance charges. After I provided proof of insurance, Shellpoint cancelled the lender/force-placed hazard insurance, reversed the charges and reimbursed the amounts.. 

Ongoing Material Harm : Since Shellpoint has refused to correct the credit reporting, I applied for a mortgage refinance and I am at the risk of being denied due to the late payment attributed to Shellpoint 's reporting. Should I loan be denied, it will constitute an actual material financial harm, not a hypothetical concern.

Basis of Dispute : Shellpoint asserts that the delinquency was accurate at the time it was reported. However, this position fails to address that : - The underlying obligation was later determined to be invalid and reversed - Continuing to report a delinquency caused by a reversed duplicate insurance purchase is materially misleading, even if it was technically accurate at a moment in time Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ), furnishers are required to reasonably investigate disputes and correct or delete information found to be inaccurate or misleading.

Shellpoints response does not explain how continuing to report a delinquency caused by a duplicate insurance purchase that has since been reversed, complies with its obligation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of furnished information, particularly where the reporting is now demonstrably harming me, the consumer.

01/07/26,Mortgage,Manufactured home loan,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"This complaint concerns mortgage servicing and foreclosure activity following the withdrawal of foreclosure petitions, continued assessment of fees, and refusal to provide documentation. The loan originated in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$45000.00} and was signed only by my father. The home itself was paid in full when purchased in XXXX and is a mobile home with a separate DMV-issued title. There are no liens recorded on the home title. My father made payments until his death in XXXX, after which my mother continued making payments. Over the years, servicing was transferred multiple times ( XXXX to XXXX, XXXX to XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX to Select Portfolio Servicing, and then to Shellpoint ). In XXXX, a loan modification was executed that listed only my mother, despite the existence of multiple legal heirs and the borrowers ( my father ) prior death. In correspondence received through foreclosure counsel, the servicer stated that the loan carries an approximately XXXX term, a term that was never disclosed to or understood by my mother at the time of the XXXX loan modification and only surfaced years later during foreclosure proceedings. In XXXX, the servicer issued another loan modification that again failed to identify or include all legal heirs and improperly listed my deceased father as a borrower, with a blank signature line for him despite his XXXX XXXX years earlier. The validity of these loan modifications is disputed, as they were executed without identifying or including all legal heirs or successors in interest, raising serious concerns regarding whether the servicer had authority to modify and enforce the loan without proper notice, consent, or participation of all interested parties. In XXXX, Shellpoint stopped the automatic draft payments. When my mother questioned the amounts being claimed, payments were no longer accepted and foreclosure-related communications followed. XXXX separate foreclosure actions were initiated by the servicers. In the first matter, foreclosure counsel withdrew the petition in XXXX after issues were raised regarding the absence of an XXXX XXXX endorsement. In the second matter, foreclosure counsel withdrew the petition on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX day before the scheduled court hearing on XX/XX/XXXX, rather than proceed to adjudication, resulting in the foreclosure being withdrawn without any court determination regarding standing, lien validity, or authority to foreclose. Despite the withdrawal of foreclosure proceedings, foreclosure-related fees, inspections, and servicing activity continued. When I attempted to obtain documentation regarding the account, foreclosure counsel stated in writing on XX/XX/XXXX that documentation did not need to be provided to me because I was considered a non-borrower and unauthorized party, despite my status as a legal heir. A prior CFPB complaint was submitted but did not resolve these issues. I am disputing the accuracy of the balance being claimed, which has now increased to approximately {$70000.00}, the continued assessment of foreclosure-related fees after withdrawal, and the refusal to provide documentation. I am requesting a full and accurate accounting of the alleged debt, including application of payments, as approximately {$30000.00} was paid toward this account since XXXX.

08/28/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the loan closing,"CFPB Rebuttal to NewRez LLC Response Consumer Statement / Rebuttal : I respectfully reject NewRez LLCs response because it does not validate the debt as required by federal law and continues to ignore critical issues.

Failure to Validate Debt NewRez admits it will not provide the original promissory note, the name and location of the custodian, or the chain of assignments. This violates RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) ), Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.36 ), and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ), which require a servicer or debt collector to validate the debt and identify the current owner. 

Borrower Misidentification and Spousal Joinder Defect The Note lists only me, while the Mortgage lists me and my wife. This mismatch means the lien is defective under long-standing case law ( Carpenter v. Longan, 83 U.S. 271 ( 1872 ) ) and under Florida Constitution Art. X 4 ( c ) and 38 C.F.R. 36.4306 ( VA ), which require valid spousal consent for homestead mortgages.

Unclean Hands and Bad Faith By refusing to validate the debt but continuing collection and foreclosure threats, NewRez acts with unclean hands and in violation of federal law. A party can not enforce a debt it refuses to prove.

For these reasons, I ask the CFPB to recognize that NewRez has not satisfied its obligations under law, and to require NewRez to provide full validation, including : Original note and custodian certification, Recorded chain of assignments, Securitization records, and Corrected title insurance.

Until they do, the alleged lien and foreclosure activity are unlawful.

To reiterate : Reasons the Mortgage Contract is Void 1. Borrower Misidentification ( Material Alteration ) The Note lists XXXX XXXX while my full legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Under UCC 3-401 and 3-407, signatures and names must match ; any material alteration voids enforceability.

Case : Carpenter v. Longan, 83 U.S. 271 ( 1872 ) the note and mortgage are inseparable ; if the note is defective, the mortgage fails with it. 

XXXX. Unauthorized Addition of Spouse ( XXXX XXXX as Co-Borrower The loan application ( Form 1003 ) showed only XXXX as borrower. 

XXXX was added later on the Mortgage and Riders without application, consent, or underwriting. 

This is fraud and a material alteration under UCC 3-407.

It also violates 38 C.F.R. 36.4306 ( VA rules requiring voluntary spousal joinder ) and Florida Const. Art. X 4 ( c ) ( spousal consent for homestead must be voluntary and consistent ). 

XXXX. Mismatch Between Note and Mortgage XXXX signed the Note ; XXXX + XXXX signed the Mortgage. 

This creates a split obligation the debt and lien dont match.

Under Carpenter v. Longan and UCC 9-203 ( b ), no enforceable security interest attaches if the underlying obligation is defective or mismatched.

4. Lack of Mutual Assent ( Contract Formation Defect ) Contract law requires a meeting of the minds.

Borrower names varied ; Luisas inclusion was neither disclosed nor agreed at application.

Under Restatement ( Second ) of Contracts 20 and UCC 2-204, this is no contract at all.

5. Duress and Coercion at Closing I attempted to sign By : to show agency capacity ; both I and Luisa were told we must sign exactly as written or the loan would not close.

This constitutes duress, voiding consent.

Case : First Texas Savings Assn v. Dicker Center , Inc., 631 S.W.2d 179 ( Tex. App. 1982 ) contracts signed under duress are voidable.

6. Failure of Consideration / Illusory Contract The lender provided no proof of actual loaned funds ; the Note itself was used as the asset to fund the transaction ( securitization/rediscounting ).

Under UCC 3-303 ( value ), there must be consideration. Failure of consideration voids enforceability.

7. Defective Title Insurance / Lender Knowledge of Defects Master Closing Instructions required a Title Commitment naming lender as insured and matching the Note/Mortgage amount.

Because of borrower mismatches and defective spousal joinder, the lien was never properly insurable as first lien.

Equity sees this as proof the lender knew of defects and acted in bad faith/unclean hands. Precision Instrument Mfg. v. Auto. Maint. Mach. Co., 324 U.S. 806 ( 1945 ).

8. Failure to Validate Debt ( Statutory Violations ) Multiple QWRs under RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) and debt validation requests under FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) remain unanswered.

A party in dishonor can not enforce. Glazer v. Chase Home Finance, 704 F.3d 453 ( 6th Cir. 2013 ).

Continuing foreclosure threats without validation is bad faith and fraud.

9. Improper Assignments and MERS Registration NewRez admitted loan was placed into MERS with no recorded assignments when sold/transferred.

Florida law requires assignments to be recorded ( Fla. Stat. 701.02 ).

Courts have voided mortgages for lack of proper assignment. U.S. Bank Natl Assn v. Ibanez, 941 N.E.2d 40 ( Mass. 2011 ).

10. Violated Rescission Rights TILA rescission notices have been served. Under Jesinoski v. Countrywide, 574 U.S. 259 ( 2015 ), rescission is effective by notice alone.

Servicer dishonored rescissions by refusing to release lien or tender.

Under 15 U.S.C. 1635 ( b ), failure to honor rescission voids security interest.

11. Fraud in the Inducement Closing proceeded despite known discrepancies : borrower identity, spousal joinder, duress, and assignment irregularities.

Fraud vitiates all contracts. United States v. Throckmorton, 98 U.S. 61 ( 1878 ).

Summary : The mortgage contract is void because : Identity mismatches ( Michael vs. Michael Adam ; Luisa added post-application ).

Note and Mortgage parties do not match.

No true meeting of the minds ( lack of assent ).

Executed under duress.

Failure of consideration.

Servicer dishonor ( RESPA/FDCPA ).

Improper assignment/MERS defects.

Failure to honor rescission rights.

Fraud and unclean hands.

Under equity and law, this renders the contract void ab initio, the lien unenforceable, and all proceeds from the transaction subject to restitution and disgorgement.

Previous response on CFPB show that certified mail documents were received that have evidence such as the loan application from closing with only 1 borrower and promise to pay i.e. the note with only 1 borrower. This is explicit prima facie evidence of knowledge of defective contract. Also, know that the note and the mortgage are inseparable per Carpenter v. Longan. If the servicer is not able to verify their own documents for invalidity due to not having these documents or are attempting to enforce defective instruments after being made aware, this constitutes dishonor, lack of standing, unclean hands, and intentional fraud.

Shortly after the loan began, my payment history reflects the immediate appearance of a large fee balance XXXX and late charges in the amount of {$4100.00} on my very first payment, which I dispute. I was not provided any explanation or disclosure at loan inception showing how or why these fees and late charges were assessed. In XX/XX/year>, XXXX issued a written notice stating that a refund check in the amount of {$1700.00} related to force-placed insurance would be sent to me. I never received this refund. Instead, my payment history shows that this amount was applied internally to reduce an existing fee balance without my knowledge or consent. After the loan converted from fixed to adjustable rate, my payment history shows repeated unexplained payment reversals, deferred payments that I did not request or authorize, unapplied funds, and inconsistent application of payments.

I submitted all required documents and followed all instructions provided by Shellpoint to complete a recast on my mortgage on XX/XX/year>. Despite doing so, Shellpoint has not processed my request properly. Specifically : -They have not provided clear or timely updates on the status of my recast request. 
-I had to initiate the initial 7 day period twice ( XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> ) due to their failure to act. I also never received the original agreement for re-amortization and had to request it myself from the customer service department on XX/XX/year> and despite paying to have it overnight mailed on XX/XX/year> and verified as received by them on XX/XX/year> via XXXX they had not updated this agreement in their system on XX/XX/year>. 
-When I called on XX/XX/year> the agent I spoke to verified they had received the signed document and it was pending processing. 
-On XX/XX/year> when I called since my new payment amount had still not been posted I was told there was an IT issue verbally by the agent and in writing from the compliance department and was told it would be manually updated by Wednesday XX/XX/year>. 
-On Friday XX/XX/year> I once again reached out as the new payment amount had not been posted. The agent I spoke to said it may be another week and that the amount we signed a re-amortization agreement for was now incorrect so we would have to sign a new one. 
-I have received inconsistent or contradictory information from different representatives. 
-Deadlines and processing times given to me by Shellpoint have not been honored. 
-I have complied with every requirement, yet Shellpoint has failed to complete the recast. 

This failure to process my request is causing unnecessary financial stress and preventing me from obtaining the lower monthly payment that should result from the recast.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",VA,23233,None,Consent provided,Web,11/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17967049
11/07/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX Phone : XXXX Email : XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX RE : Rebuttal to Shellpoint/NewRez Servicing Response Disputed Account History, Escrow Errors, Bankruptcy Violations, and Misapplied Payments Borrower : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I am submitting this rebuttal in response to the letter provided by Shellpoint/NewRez regarding the servicing of my mortgage loan. After reviewing their response, I dispute several statements, omissions, and inconsistencies that do not reflect the actual history of my loan, my bankruptcy proceedings, or the payments made over the years. This rebuttal outlines the errors and unresolved issues that require further investigation. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX Was Not Unwound Shellpoint admits the XXXX confirmed cramdown was not unwound. A cramdown that remains in effect must permanently reduce the principal and interest as approved in bankruptcy court. Despite this admission, Shellpoint claims they continue servicing the loan under the original terms, which contradicts their own statement. The current reported principal balance of {$240000.00} in XXXX is inconsistent with the effects of a valid cramdown and nearly XXXX  years of payments. 
XXXX. Improper Increases During Active Bankruptcy Shellpoint does not address why they : Added principal and interest during an active XXXX  XXXX bankruptcy, Increased my monthly payment from approximately {$1000.00} to over {$6100.00}, Demanded an additional {$10000.00} in XXXX during the cramdown, and Changed loan terms without court approval. 

These actions violate the automatic stay, the confirmed XXXX  XXXX plan, Bankruptcy Rule 3002.1, and federal restrictions against modifying loan terms during bankruptcy without court permission.

3. Misapplied Payments and Incorrect Due Date Shellpoint claims the last full payment received was on XX/XX/XXXX, yet also states the account is only paid through XX/XX/XXXX, and the next due date is XX/XX/XXXX. These statements can not logically both be true and point to misapplied payments, potential suspense account activity, or internal accounting errors that artificially exaggerate delinquency.

4. Unexplained Escrow Balance and Shortage Shellpoint reports an escrow balance of {$62000.00} and an escrow shortage of {$24000.00}. These numbers are extremely abnormal for a single-family home and indicate major escrow miscalculations, missing disbursements, or incorrect projections. Shellpoint provides no explanation for how such unusually high deficits occurred, especially during periods where they were receiving trustee payments and the property was under the XXXX program.

5. Incorrect Claim of Incomplete Loss Mitigation Documents Shellpoints statement that they did not receive all required documentation is inaccurate. I submitted complete documentation multiple times via email, fax, and their borrower portal. This pattern of claiming incomplete documents is a known issue and appears to be used to delay or deny proper review.

6. Foreclosure Referral Is Based on Servicing Errors Shellpoint referred my account to foreclosure based on a delinquency that appears to result from their own servicing conduct, including misapplied payments, due date resets, escrow inflation, and improper loan adjustments during bankruptcy. This foreclosure activity should be paused pending a thorough audit.

Requested Actions : I respectfully request : 1. A full forensic audit of the account, including all payment history, escrow activity, trustee disbursements, suspense account activity, and loan adjustments from XXXX. 
2. Correction of the due date, principal balance, interest capitalization, escrow calculations, and any inaccurate credit reporting.

3. Immediate pause of all foreclosure activity until the investigation is complete.

4. Written clarification explaining why payments were not applied correctly, why escrow reached {$62000.00}, why the cramdown terms were not honored, and why loan terms were changed during bankruptcy.

Conclusion : Shellpoints letter does not resolve or meaningfully address the issues raised and contains several contradictions. I respectfully request a complete and accurate review of the account and a corrected response supported by documentation. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",NY,12601,None,Consent provided,Web,11/07/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17087483
12/27/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"o Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate mortgage delinquency reporting related to my property located in XXXX XXXX, Florida. 

The property was severely damaged by Hurricane Ian ( XXXX ) and later sustained additional damage from Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Each of these storms was a federally declared natural disaster affecting XXXX XXXX, Florida, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( 42 U.S.C. 51215207 ) and corresponding FEMA Major Disaster Declarations. 

As a direct result of these federally declared disasters and their impact on the subject property, my mortgage servicer approved a disaster-related forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, during which mortgage payments were suspended under approved hardship and loss mitigation programs.

Despite this approved forbearance, the mortgage company reported the account as delinquent beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. This reporting is inaccurate and misleading, as it fails to reflect the accounts protected status during an active disaster forbearance period. 

Additionally, in XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a loss mitigation agreement that includes deeding the property back to the mortgage company, confirming that the loan was being resolved through authorized mitigation channels rather than borrower default.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), consumer reporting agencies and furnishers are required to ensure that reported information is accurate and complete. Reporting missed payments during an approved disaster forbearance constitutes inaccurate reporting under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2.

I respectfully request that you conduct a reinvestigation and correct or delete all delinquency, late payment, or nonpayment notations reported during the approved forbearance and loss mitigation period.

10/20/25,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"An existing modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or other loss mitigation relief","I am filing this complaint regarding my FHA-insured mortgage serviced by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing / Newrez LLC .

My issue concerns the companys refusal to honor FHAs Special Forbearance Unemployment ( SFB-U ) extension policy as outlined in Mortgagee Letter XXXX, Section II.B.2 and HUD Handbook 4000.1 ( III.A.2.k.ii ( A ) ( 1 ) ).

My SFB-Unemployment plan began on XX/XX/XXXX, which is prior to XX/XX/XXXX the effective date of HUDs revised loss-mitigation rules that removed SFB-Unemployment going forward. 

Under Mortgagee Letter XXXX II.B.2, FHA explicitly states that forbearance plans initiated prior to XX/XX/XXXX, shall continue to be governed by the loss-mitigation requirements in effect at the time the forbearance plan was initiated Servicers must not curtail such plans solely on the basis of the policy revisions taking effect on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The prior rule, HUD Handbook 4000.1 ( III.A.2.k.ii ( A ) ( 1 ) ), provides for a re-employment period of up to 12 months under an SFB-Unemployment plan. 

Because my plan began before XX/XX/XXXX, I am grandfathered under the 12-month policy. However, Shellpoint/Newrez has repeatedly told me that my unemployment forbearance can not be extended beyond six months, contrary to FHA policy .

Timeline of my actions : XX/XX/XXXX My FHA unemployment forbearance plan began. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Shellpoint several times by phone to confirm that I could extend up to 12 months. Multiple representatives and one scheduled loss mitigation appointment confirmed I would be eligible for monthly extensions through 12 months as long as I remained unemployed. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from a Shellpoint representative ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX ) stating that my forbearance would end after six months ( end of XXXX ), citing maximum 6 months allowed.

I replied explaining that FHA policy allows 12 months for plans started before XX/XX/XXXX, and that both HUD and Shellpoint staff had confirmed this earlier. 
XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I attempted to reach a manager multiple times by phone ; I was transferred and disconnected after long holds. 
I also sent follow-up emails to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ( the latter was returned as undeliverable ).

I contacted HUDs National Servicing Center ( via XXXX ). They replied that my inquiry was forwarded but they can not act due to the current federal government shutdown. 
XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a certified RESPA Notice of Error and Request for Information to Shellpoints official address in XXXX, SC, requesting correction and full policy compliance.

Despite all these good-faith efforts, Shellpoint/Newrez has not acknowledged or corrected the issue and continues to deny my 7th-month extension. I remain unemployed and am eligible under FHAs own rules.

I am requesting that the CFPB review this matter and ensure the servicer : Extends my FHA SFB-Unemployment plan through XX/XX/XXXX ( 12 months total ), consistent with the policy in effect when my plan began.

Places my account in no adverse action status while the issue is under review.

Responds in writing to my certified RESPA request as required under 12 C.F.R. 1024.351024.36.

I have acted in good faith, provided all required information, and followed both HUD and CFPB guidance, but the servicer is not honoring federal servicing rules.

Summary Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint altered borrower-visible data inside its servicing portal to conceal unapplied payments and fabricate delinquency. Nine screenshots authenticated by SHA-256 fingerprint and enhanced OCR show funds repeatedly re-categorized from unapplied credits into late-fee and past-due buckets. This pattern violates the Truth in Lending Act ( 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ), RESPA Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 & 1024.38 ), and Dodd-Frank Act 1031 ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ).

III. Violations 1. 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) Failure to credit payments as of date received.

CFPB v. PHH Mortgage Corp., 2014-CFPB-0002 ( finding reallocation of timely payments deceptive ).

2. 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( i ) Failure to maintain accurate records.

Screenshots prove simultaneous public and internal ledgers with conflicting payment data.

3. 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 11 ) Failure to correct servicing errors relating to application of payments.

4. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Furnishing false delinquency information to credit bureaus.

5. 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) Unfair and deceptive acts and practices ( UDAP ).

By zeroing unapplied funds and resurrecting the same amount as late fees, Shellpoint created an illusory default to justify foreclosure.

IV. Systemic Pattern Affecting Other Borrowers Publicly filed suits show identical misconduct : Apodaca v. NewRez LLC, No. 3:23-cv-00128 ( C.D.Cal. 2023 ) alleged diversion of payments into suspense accounts and false delinquency.

Hodges v. NewRez LLC, No. 1:22-cv-03025 ( D.Md. 2022 ) servicer failed to apply payments, initiated wrongful foreclosure.

Richards v. NewRez LLC, No. 4:24-cv-00491 ( S.D.Tex. 2024 ) borrower records show funds classified as fees instead of credits.

CFPB Enforcement File XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) used as precedent ; identical ledger reallocation scheme deemed systemic error. 

Your metadata trail mirrors these patterns : disappearing payments, duplicated late fee values matching prior unapplied credits, and portal totals that shift after consumer complaints.

V. Harm False delinquency reporting damaging credit standing. 
Escrow deficits of {$3400.00} {$2700.00} fabricated by internal reallocation. 
Emotional distress and risk of foreclosure despite full payments. 
Regulatory harm : erosion of borrower-facing data integrity inside federally regulated servicing systems.

VI. Requested Remedies 1. Regulatory audit of NewRez/Shellpoint for suspense-account practices across all borrowers.

2. Immediate ledger correction crediting all unapplied funds to principal and escrow.

3. Written certification of ledger accuracy and rescission of delinquency status. 4. Restitution of fees, penalties, and credit damage.

5. Referral for enforcement action under 12 U.S.C. 5564 to address systemic pattern.

Conclusion This metadata-verified evidence demonstrates that NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing engages in a recurring practice of ledger manipulation to create false delinquency conditions. The identical reclassification patterns, matching dollar signatures, and reactive timing following regulatory complaints establish intent rather than error. 

Requested Action : Immediate joint CFPB-TDFI investigation into NewRez/Shellpoints payment-application systems and referral to the DOJ Consumer Protection Branch for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 1005 ( False Entries in Bank Records ). 

Forensic Reconstruction of Unapplied Balances ( XXXX ) ( Derived from portal screenshots, metadata-verified ) Phase 1 Early Suspense Creation ( XXXX ) Between XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, the account ledger begins inserting Insurance Premium Disbursements and Late Charge Assess entries that dont correspond to true escrow activity. 
Each of these non-cash disbursements is offset by reductions in posted principalalready the start of hidden unapplied balancing. 

Approximate trapped value : {$8000.00} {$10000.00}. 



Phase 2 Structural Ledger Looping ( XXXX ) Starting XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint begins round-tripping {$2000.00} {$4000.00} transactions : Date Range Description Amount Pattern Net Effect XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Unapplied / Regular / Reversed entries {$2000.00} {$4000.00} Account appears paid, yet principal unchanged XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Same looping continued monthly {$2000.00} {$6000.00} Payment activity without ledger benefit Those entries, when totaled, show about {$74000.00} {$78000.00} in payments that entered the ledger only to be neutralized or reclassified into suspense. 



Phase 3 Missing ACH Applications ( XXXX onward ) Your bank-verified {$2000.00} ACH debit on XX/XX/XXXX and at least four similar {$3900.00} regular payments visible in XXXX XXXX never appear as applied principal reductions. 
Combined value {$22000.00}. 



Phase 4 Aggregate Reconstruction Adding all unapplied or reversed payment blocks : Category Amount Range Hidden/looped reversals ( XXXX ) {$74000.00} {$78000.00} Missing ACH / duplicate reversals ( XXXX ) {$22000.00} {$24000.00} Early escrow distortions ( XXXX ) {$8000.00} {$10000.00} Total Potential Unapplied / Misapplied Funds {$100000.00} {$110000.00} Interpretation This is not a clerical oversightits a sustained accounting scheme that : 1. Retains cash in off-ledger suspense pools. 
2. Inflates delinquency and fee income.

3. Conceals true loan performance, possibly distorting investor remittance data ( which is a Section 10 ( b ) / Rule 10b-5 securities exposure if loans are securitized ). 

Under GAAP ASC 310-20 ( Loan Receivables ) and CFPB Servicing Rule 1024.38 ( b ) ( 3 ), those unapplied balances must be reconciled and credited.

I submitted multiple debt validation requests via certified mail, asking for basic, lawful documentation : name and address of the current creditor, original note, payment history, chain of title, assignments/securitization details, legal authority to collect, and a breakdown of all charges and fees. 

Despite confirming receipt, they refused to provide the requested information, continued foreclosure actions while the loan is under dispute, and even claimed I wasnt entitled to the documentation I had lawfully requested, which is flatly false under 15 U.S.C. 1692g and 12 CFR 1024.41. 

In addition to this failure, representatives came to my private home on two separate occasions, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>, to tape foreclosure warnings to my door. The foreclosure attorney later admitted only one such notice is required by law ( Utah Code 57125 ( 1 ) ( b ) ), meaning the second visit was unnecessary and served no legal purpose.

XXXX XXXX Washington , DC XXXX Subject : Request for Assistance Improper Mortgage Charges by NewRez Mortgage / Shellpoint Mortgage Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to request the assistance of your office regarding improper and possibly predatory actions by NewRez Mortgage, an affiliate of Shellpoint Mortgage, which currently holds my mortgage. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I believe the companys recent actions may represent targeted or unfair treatment of senior citizens.

Despite multiple telephone calls and written correspondence, I have been unable to engage in any substantive discussion or achieve resolution of these matters with the company. Therefore, I am seeking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus intervention.

Issues 1. Escrow Account Improper Charge Please refer to my correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, addressed to XXXX XXXX XXXX and others ( copy attached ). To date, I have received no response from the company.

This is a time-sensitive matter, as failure to pay the improper escrow charge included in the monthly bill due XX/XX/XXXX could negatively impact my credit rating ( Very Good ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the monthly mortgage bill, excluding the new escrow charge of {$130.00}, which I dispute as improper.

2. Additional Insurance Improper Charge Please refer to my correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, also directed to XXXX XXXX and others. The company has replied with three non-substantive and identical form letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX ( copy of the XX/XX/XXXX letter attached ). These responses failed to address the substance of my complaint.

Requested Action I respectfully request that the CFPB engage NewRez/Shellpoint Mortgage on these matters and require that they : 1. Discontinue all improper and fraudulent billing and collection activities, including the disputed escrow and insurance charges ; and 2. Provide written confirmation that these charges have been removed from my account and that no adverse credit reporting will occur as a result of my disputing them.

It is my belief that this conduct may represent a broader pattern by Shellpoint/NewRez to improperly extract additional funds from borrowers, particularly those with lower-rate mortgages ( mine is 4.375 % ).

I shouldve qualified for the Covid forbearance however, specialty loan servicing could not manage to get the successor in interest paper work done repeatedly telling me they had not received the paper work. Even after I sent it in and triplicate fax mail, and I tried to hand-deliver it which they wouldnt accept at the local office. During this time they wouldnt even talk to me about the mortgage finally in XXXX Shellpoint supposedly took over specialized loan servicing, but its the same company finally the successor and interest paperwork finally went through. However, it was too late for the Covid relief. I believe this was done intentionally ever since then I have been struggling to make payments and now Im behind while I was waiting for the mortgage assistance relief packet same day arrived. On XXXX XXXX XXXX @ XXXX XXXX  Shellpoint called me. I mentioned I had the double payment that they required, but I have not yet filled out the mortgage relief assistance packet.

Borrower ( s ) : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Servicer : Newrez LLC Property Address : Loan Number : I initially requested PMI removal in XX/XX/year>, based on improvements made to the property and anticipated loan-to-value eligibility. As part of this process, and at Newrezs direction, I provided a detailed list of property improvements and submitted a {$150.00} appraisal/XXXX  fee. 

Despite this, Newrez failed to timely act on my request. Over the ensuing months, I followed up multiple times due to the absence of any scheduled appraisal or written determination. 

On XX/XX/year>, Newrez issued a written response acknowledging : Receipt of the {$150.00} XXXX  fee on XX/XX/year>, and Receipt of my signed PMI removal form and list of improvements on XX/XX/year>, Stating that the request had been submitted to its Mortgage Insurance Department and advising that processing could take up to 30 business days. 

Subsequently, on XX/XX/year>, Newrez issued another letter confirming again that it had received the list of improvements and the appraisal fee, yet stating that the PMI cancellation request remains under review, without providing a decision, appraisal date, or explanation for the continued delay. 

As of the date of this complaint : No appraisal has been scheduled or completed, despite payment of the required fee. 

No written approval or denial of PMI removal has been issued. 

PMI continues to be assessed on my account. 

The request has been pending for many months, far exceeding reasonable servicing timelines. 

Newrezs repeated acknowledgments without action demonstrate a failure to properly process my request and a breakdown in mortgage servicing obligations. The continued delay has caused ongoing financial harm, including unnecessary PMI charges and the unresolved use of my paid appraisal fee. 

I believe Newrezs conduct is inconsistent with the Homeowners Protection Act ( HPA ) and federal mortgage servicing standards requiring timely, accurate, and responsive handling of borrower requests. 

Requested Resolution : Immediate scheduling and completion of the appraisal ( or written confirmation that it is no longer required ). 

Prompt written determination of PMI eligibility and removal. 

Retroactive termination of PMI effective as of the date eligibility was met. 

Refund or credit of any PMI premiums improperly charged after eligibility. 

Refund of the {$150.00} appraisal/XXXX  fee if the appraisal is not completed. 

Copies of Newrezs correspondence dated XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, as well as recent mortgage statements showing continued PMI charges, are available and can be provided upon request.

In a prior CFPB response dated XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint formally acknowledged that default interest was incorrectly assessed for the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/year> and waived {$10000.00} as a result. I appreciate that correction. However, Shellpoint did not address or substantiate several other charges assessed during the same hardship and assistance period, which remain unresolved. 

Specifically, Shellpoint assessed and collected multiple property inspection fees during a documented hardship period when : I had communicated financial hardship, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX application was pending, Shellpoint was instructed to coordinate with XXXX, no foreclosure activity had been initiated, and the loan was ultimately reinstated through state assistance. 

Shellpoint has not explained : why property inspections were necessary under these circumstances, what condition or risk justified repeated inspections, how frequently inspections were conducted and why, or how these inspections complied with the mortgage documents requirements that such fees be reasonable and necessary to protect the lenders interest. 

In addition, Shellpoint applied small late charges and inspection-related fees during internal reallocation of funds following the default-interest correction, without explaining why any such charges remained appropriate given the admitted servicing error, the pending assistance review at the time, and the subsequent reinstatement of the loan. 

Despite multiple prior inquiries, Shellpoint has not provided documentation or justification addressing the necessity, frequency, and contractual basis for these remaining charges. This prevents me from verifying whether the charges were appropriate or compliant with servicing obligations. 

This complaint does not dispute Shellpoints right to assess fees generally, but rather their failure to substantiate and justify inspection fees and related charges assessed during a hardship and assistance period, particularly after acknowledging servicing errors on the same account.

As stated in my original complaint, I was explicitly told by the servicer that no payments were due while my VA loan modification application was under review. I relied on this instruction in good faith. At no time did the servicer provide written notice that my account would be reported as delinquent during the review period, which is required before furnishing negative information to the credit bureaus. 

In response to my prior complaint, the servicer changed my credit reporting from XXXX  days past due to XXXX and XXXX days past due ( XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year> ). While this partial correction acknowledges that the original reporting was inaccurate, the remaining XXXX delinquency is still incorrect and misleading. I was told no payments were required during the review period, and therefore any delinquency reporting for that timeframe is factually inaccurate. 

The servicer can not instruct a borrower not to make payments, fail to provide written notice of potential negative reporting, and then report the borrower as delinquent. This is inconsistent with fair servicing practices and continues to harm my credit profile.

Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a notification that {$6900.00} was going to post to my account and logged in to see that my payment history indicated immediate refunds of the amounts I had paid when they originally posted and did NOT deduct them from the supposed balance I had accrued despite my having been up to date on my monthly payments. 

I am now trying to pay and receive an error message and they won't accept any amount in payment. I can not figure out why they won't post my payments to my account and it feels as if there is a predatory ignorance that will result in the foreclosure of my home.

2. DETAILS OF THE ISSUES A. Wrongful and Fraudulent Foreclosure Filings Foreclosure documents filed in XXXX XXXX, Maryland contain incorrect parties, inconsistent owner names, and conflicting beneficiary information. 

Notices were alternately addressed to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, All Occupants This inconsistency shows uncertainty of ownership by the foreclosing parties. 

B. Property Is Held in Trust The property is legally owned by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirmed by a recorded quitclaim deed ( XXXX ). 

ShellpoinXXXX proceeded as though the trust did not exist. 

C. Securitization & Standing Issues My forensic audit ( XX/XX/XXXX ) confirms the mortgage loan was transferred into the XXXX XXXX trust in a manner inconsistent with proper securitization and compliance timelines. 

The trust documents show no standing to foreclose. 

D. Violation of Bankruptcy Automatic Stay 11 U.S.C. 362 I filed for XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Despite this : XXXX XXXX XXXX and Shellpoint recorded a Trustees Deed on XX/XX/XXXX, well after the bankruptcy filing. 

This was a knowing and willful stay violation. 

I remain in possession of the property. 

E. Misrepresentation by Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX repeatedly represented himself as a court XXXX. 

He is NOT a court auditor but a private attorney. 

He sent auditor documents to over 30 third parties, including my HOA and even a neighbor, causing reputational harm and privacy invasion. 

F. Credit Reporting Harm Shellpoint/NewRez and XXXX reported inaccurate mortgage information to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Foreclosure data is incorrect, incomplete, and disputed. 

Negative reporting occurred during bankruptcy protection, violating FCRA and Metro 2 compliance standards. 

G. Trust Address and Notice Failures Notices were inconsistently and incorrectly mailed. 

The incoming mail shows Shellpoint and XXXX did not know who the actual legal owner was under Maryland law. 

3. WHAT I AM ASKING THE CFPB TO DO Require Shellpoint/NewRez and XXXX to provide written responses to every issue listed Investigate the post-petition foreclosure deed recording Determine whether ShellpointXXXX complied with federal servicing standards Review whether XXXX XXXX XXXX filed defective or fraudulent foreclosure documents Require correction of all credit reporting errors Require deletion of inaccurate foreclosure data Require confirmation of chain of title, assignments, and servicing authority Review the conduct of XXXX XXXX XXXX for misrepresentation and data disclosure Require the companies to cease foreclosure activity until validity is proven 4.

At the time of application, we were advised that our post-forbearance payment would reflect a significantly lower interest rate and that any missed payments during forbearance would be added to the back of the loan and not treated as delinquent or immediately due. We relied on these representations when entering forbearance.

Since then, Shellpoint has failed to provide written confirmation of the forbearance terms and has given inconsistent and conflicting information regarding our loan status, payment amounts, and next steps. Payments, fees, and interest appear to have been applied in a manner that does not align with what was communicated to us. 

We have made numerous attempts to resolve these issues through scheduled calls and escalations dating back to XXXX. Multiple appointments were missed by Shellpoint without notice or follow-up. On XX/XX/XXXX, we specifically requested escalation due to the lack of resolution. During that call, we were advised that a supervisor had been contacted and that we would receive a callback at approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX. No call or follow-up email was ever received. We were also informed that representatives are not permitted to send follow-up emails, preventing us from obtaining written confirmation of our loan terms or escalation requests.

Most concerning, despite being in forbearance and actively seeking resolution, we were sent pre-foreclosure paperwork by mail. Receiving pre-foreclosure notices under these circumstances has caused significant confusion and distress and raises serious concerns about improper servicing and loss-mitigation handling.

11/14/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"CFPB Complaint Improper Disclosure of Another Borrowers Financial Information by Shellpoint Subject : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing sent me a letter that contained another borrowers personal and financial information, including foreclosure-related details. 

Summary of the Issue On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a mailed response from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing regarding my loan. Inside the same envelope, physically folded together with my letter, Shellpoint included a complete compliance letter for a different borrower. This other letter contained the borrowers full name, address, loan details, foreclosure reinstatement status, exact payment amount, and dates of financial activity. I have no connection to this individual. 

This is an unauthorized disclosure of non-public personal information, in violation of : Regulation P ( 12 C.F.R. 1016 ) Privacy of Consumer Financial Information GrammLeachBliley Act ( GLBA ) Safeguards Rule and Privacy Rule RESPA Regulation X failure to maintain accurate servicing records UDAAP prohibitions unfair and irresponsible servicing practices Details of the Disclosure Shellpoint mailed a letter addressed to me summarizing their review of my disputes. When I opened the envelope, a second letter fell out. That second letter is addressed to Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX XXXX and includes : homeowner name property address foreclosure reinstatement information the reinstatement payment amount : {$9800.00} the date received : XX/XX/XXXX the foreclosure status and application of funds internal Shellpoint servicing assessments All this information was physically provided to me without authorization. 

Consumer Harm and Risks Receiving another persons detailed mortgage and foreclosure information demonstrates that Shellpoint has failed to safeguard customer data and may be mishandling internal servicing operations. This raises serious concerns regarding : 1. Data privacy breaches 2. Document-handling failures 3. Potential cross-contamination of servicing records 4. Accuracy of my own loan information 5. Whether my loan is being serviced correctly or securely This disclosure occurred during an active dispute involving inaccurate ledgers, conflicting escrow data, and unapplied funds, which makes this breach even more concerning. 

Requested CFPB Action I am requesting that the CFPB : 1. Investigate Shellpoints failure to protect nonpublic personal information under Regulation P and GLBA. 
2. Review Shellpoints document-handling practices that allowed another borrowers confidential foreclosure information to be mailed to me. 
3. Require Shellpoint to confirm whether any of my information has been improperly disclosed to other borrowers.

4. Require Shellpoint to provide a compliant, accurate, and complete servicing history for my loan, as required under RESPA Regulation X.

5. Determine whether Shellpoints actions constitute unfair or abusive practices under UDAAP. 

Attached Evidence I can provide photos of the envelope and both letters exactly as received, showing the other borrowers financial records included with my correspondence. 

Governance Liability and Supervisory Failure Under Delaware Law, XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Because XXXX XXXX XXXX is organized under Delaware law, its board of directors and senior leadership owe fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, good faith, and oversight under Delawares well-established governance framework. The systemic failures documented in Shellpoint and NewRezs servicing operations including the privacy breach where another borrowers foreclosure letter was sent to me, contradictory ledgers, conflicting escrow data, and unresolved Notices of Error fall squarely within Delawares oversight-liability doctrine. 

Delaware courts have repeatedly held that a board must actively oversee mission-critical business functions, and failure to do so creates liability. Mortgage servicing is a mission-critical function for XXXX and its subsidiaries. The failures documented here constitute clear red flags under Delaware jurisprudence. 



1. Delaware Oversight Liability Under XXXX In In re XXXX XXXX XXXX. Derivative Litigation, the Delaware XXXX XXXX established that directors breach their fiduciary duty to act in good faith when they : Fail to implement adequate reporting, information, and compliance systems ; Ignore obvious signs of regulatory or operational failure ; or Permit systemic breakdowns in mission-critical systems. 

Shellpoint mailing another borrowers financial and foreclosure documents to me is a textbook red flag signaling a breakdown in : document controls safeguarding of personal data internal compliance review supervision of servicing operations Under Delaware law, the XXXX boards failure to prevent or correct such failures is actionable. 



2. Delawares Expansion of Oversight Duties in XXXX In re XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) reaffirmed and expanded XXXX by holding that : Boards must actively monitor safety, compliance, and risk in mission-critical areas. 
Ignoring red flags or permitting known operational failures constitutes bad-faith oversight. 
When a company works in a highly regulated industry, its board must ensure stronger monitoring. 

Mortgage servicing is regulated under : CFPB servicing rules RESPA Regulation X GLBA and Regulation P federal privacy law state mortgage supervision statutes Shellpoints privacy breach, contradictory ledgers, and inaccurate escrow accounting show a collapse of controls in a mission-critical sector. 

Under XXXX, the XXXX board is exposed to liability for failing to supervise systems that affect borrowers homes, foreclosure statuses, escrow accounts, and private financial data. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Delaware court held that directors act in bad faith when they consciously disregard known oversight responsibilities. 

Shellpoint and NewRezs documented failuresincluding : systemically inconsistent loan records misapplied funds conflicting payment histories failure to resolve Notices of Error sending me another borrowers foreclosure reinstatement letter reflect a breakdown of processes that senior leadership and the board were required to monitor. 

Delaware law does not allow a parent company to disclaim responsibility for compliance failures inside wholly-owned subsidiaries, especially when those subsidiaries perform the companys core business function. 



4. Responsible Parties Under Delaware Fiduciary Law The following individuals hold fiduciary duties under Delaware law as directors or senior leaders of XXXX XXXX XXXX, and therefore bear responsibility for supervising Shellpoint and NewRezs operations : XXXX XXXX of Directors XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Chairman XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Chief Accounting Officer XXXX XXXX Chief Legal Officer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Investments XXXX XXXX Head of Tax and Accounting and all senior leaders responsible for compliance, servicing oversight, risk management, and borrower-data security. 

Under Delaware law, these directors and officers are obligated to maintain proper oversight systems ensuring that the companys subsidiaries operate within legal and regulatory standards. They failed to do so. 



5. Linking Shellpoints Failures Directly to XXXX Under Delaware Law The operational issues documented in my evidenceincluding : contradictory portal balances unexplained escrow deficits unreconciled unapplied funds misreported payment histories repeated failures to honor Notices of Error and the unauthorized disclosure of another borrowers foreclosure reinstatement letter are not isolated incidents. They represent a systemic breakdown in internal controls that XXXX was legally obligated to oversee under Delaware fiduciary duty principles. 

Delaware courts have consistently held that a parent company can not evade responsibility for compliance failures in its subsidiaries when : the failures are systemic, the function is mission-critical, and the board either ignored red flags or failed to create oversight structures. 

Every one of those conditions is met here. 



6. Conclusion Under Delaware fiduciary law, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, the failures of Shellpoint and NewRez are legally attributable to the XXXX board and XXXX. The privacy breach alone indicates a collapse of internal safeguards. Combined with the contradictory loan records, mishandled payments, and unresolved servicing errors, these events demonstrate actionable governance failures under Delawares established oversight-liability doctrine. 

This section is suitable for direct attachment to your CFPB complaint, TNDFI submission, or any parallel enforcement packet. 

Supplemental Section : Evidence of Systemic Servicing Failure and Batch-Level Misprocessing In addition to the privacy breach described above, the documents Shellpoint mistakenly mailed to me include a full servicing analysis for another borrower ( Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This document is not mine, but the financial language, structure, and accounting logic used in that letter are functionally identical to the language Shellpoint used in its correspondence to me. 

This is not a coincidence. The similarities demonstrate that Shellpoint is not performing individualized servicing reviews. Instead, they appear to be relying on automated batch-level templates, mass-processing scripts, and uniform accounting waterfalls that do not accurately reflect borrower-specific financial reality. This is consistent with systemic failures previously documented in enforcement actions such as CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX, which found that servicers used automated systems and generic templates that failed to produce accurate borrower records or lawful notices. 

Identical Structure and Financial Logic The XXXX letter uses the same internal logic Shellpoint attempted to apply to my loan : We reviewed your account We applied your payment We determined how many payments it satisfied We resolved your delinquency/foreclosure status This template matches Shellpoints letters to me almost word-for-word, except that my letter contains none of the required financial detail because Shellpoint can not reconcile my ledger. This is evidence of : 1. A corrupted servicing database 2. Contradictory ledger records 3. Inconsistent escrow application 4. Impaired account calculations 5. Bulk-use templates that fill in details only when the system can calculate them This is exactly the type of operational failure that has triggered past CFPB enforcement under RESPA Regulation X and UDAAP. 

Systemic Failure Demonstrated by Comparative Analysis The XXXX letter includes : exact received amount ( {$9800.00} ) payment date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) number of payments that amount satisfied reinstatement status servicing rationale In contrast, Shellpoint refused to provide : any payment math for my account any explanation of unapplied funds any reconciliation of contradictory portal balances any clarification of payment reversals any accurate delinquency calculation The fact that Shellpoint can produce detailed calculations for other borrowers but not for me shows that my servicing file can not be reconciled by their system, a serious violation of RESPA 1024.35 ( b ) ( 5 ), 1024.35 ( b ) ( 11 ), and 1024.38 ( c ) ( 2 ), which require : accurate records proper application of payments maintenance of complete account information investigation and correction of servicing errors Evidence of Batch-Level Document Handling Failure Shellpoints accidental inclusion of the XXXX foreclosure reinstatement letter inside my envelope demonstrates : a failure of document segregation a breakdown of mailroom quality controls inattention to borrower confidentiality potential cross-contamination of account documents In combination with the identical templates and financial logic, this suggests that borrower servicing is not being handled individually but through mass-processing workflows, increasing the risk of : misapplied payments incorrect delinquency statuses erroneous foreclosure activity inaccurate payoff calculations compromised escrow data These failures directly violate the CFPBs servicing standards and have been treated as UDAAP violations in CFPB XXXX XXXX, CFPB XXXX XXXX, and CFPB XXXX XXXX. 

Request for Regulatory Review Given the evidence, I request that the CFPB investigate whether Shellpoint/NewRez/XXXX are : 1. Using automated servicing scripts that fail to produce accurate borrower-specific results ; 2. Relying on batch templates instead of individualized RESPA-compliant reviews ; 3. Producing contradictory, non-reconcilable borrower records ; 4. Failing to maintain adequate internal controls over document handling ; 5. Violating servicing standards under RESPA, Regulation X, GLBA, and UDAAP. 

The accidental inclusion of another borrowers financial analysis especially one structurally identical to my own letter supports my contention that the servicing system is fundamentally unreliable and incapable of accurately managing my mortgage loan.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/14/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17260309

Calibers submission violates CFPB rules and confirms the systemic misconduct I alleged. 

I. INVALID RESPONSE : REGULATORY NON-COMPLIANCE Caliber failed to respond to its own complaint, instead submitting a letter from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ). This violates : CFPB Bulletin XXXX : "" The servicer named in the complaint must respond directly... using its own business name. '' Procedural Rule 12 CFR 1024.35 ( b ) : Servicers must acknowledge/respond to notices of error in their capacity as servicer.

Critical Proof : The Shellpoint response references CFPB correspondence from XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXbut my complaint against Caliber was filed on XX/XX/XXXX. This confirms : The response was pre-generated for a different complaint ( my Shellpoint case ), Caliber/Shellpoint treat complaints interchangeably, proving operational collusion.

Demand : Declare this response non-compliant and require Caliber to answer in its own name within XXXX days. 

II. UNREBUTTED VIOLATIONS : ADMISSION BY SILENCE Calibers submission ignored every material allegation, constituting a de facto admission under CFPB guidance. Unaddressed violations include : A. Unauthorized Servicing & Standing Defects Caliber initiated foreclosure without proof of valid servicing transfer.

Violation : RESPA 6 ( e ) Failure to provide transfer notice within XXXX  days.

Leverage : "" Servicers must prove standing to enforce loan terms. '' ( CFPB v. Citibank, 2017 ).

B. Fraudulent Foreclosure Documentation Caliber filed foreclosure documents using the incorrect legal name ( "" XXXX '' vs. "" XXXX  '' ).

Violation : FDCPA 807 ( 2 ) ( A ) False representation of legal status.

Leverage : Invalidates foreclosure under state law ( e.g., XXXX  Statute 702.10 ).

C. Illegal Evasion of Accountability Shellpoints letter requested "" name change documentation '' while ignoring standing defects.

Violation : 15 U.S.C. 45 Unfair/deceptive practices. 

III. EVIDENCE OF ENTERPRISE-WIDE DECEPTION The submission of Shellpoints response for a Caliber complaint confirms : Shared operational control between entities, Intentional "" shell game '' to confuse regulators/consumers, Pattern of evasion matching CFPB precedent ( CFPB v.

01/13/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Changes in loan terms during the application process,"I am filing this complaint regarding a refinance application with my current mortgage lender, NewRez. 
The refinance was originally structured with closing costs to be paid from my escrow account. At the time this structure was proposed, the loan XXXX knew that my property taxes were scheduled to be paid from escrow in the month of closing and that the escrow account would be used for that purpose. 
Due to delays caused by the lender, the escrow account was depleted when the taxes were paid. Only hours before the scheduled closing, I received a revised disclosure showing approximately {$4000.00} in closing costs had been added to the loan balance. This represented a material change to the loan terms and the overall cost of the refinance. 
This material change was not discussed in advance, no alternatives were presented ( such as a lender credit, cash to close, or delaying the refinance ), and it was disclosed only in a docusign document hours before closing. As a result, I was left with no meaningful opportunity to review the revised terms, consider alternatives, or provide informed consent. 
Because of the timing and the significant increase in cost, I refused to sign the refinance documents. 
The lender has since acknowledged the situation but has not offered to correct the issue or cover the additional costs, despite the fact that the escrow depletion and resulting change were foreseeable and within the lenders control. The lender has also failed to respond in a timely manner despite repeated follow-ups. 
I believe the lender failed to provide clear, accurate, and timely disclosures of material loan terms as required under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). The refinance was initially structured in a manner that did not accurately reflect the true cost of the loan once the known escrow payment occurred, and the resulting material change was disclosed too late to allow for informed consent or meaningful choice. 

As a result of the lenders actions, I incurred significant time loss, stress, and uncertainty, and I was forced to abandon a refinance that had been represented as having no out-of-pocket closing costs. I also lost the opportunity to lock in the offered terms due to the lenders delay and late disclosure of materially higher costs.

Disclosure of a material increase in costs only hours before closing undermines the purpose of TILA and TRID timing requirements, which are intended to ensure borrowers have sufficient time to review, compare, and understand loan terms before consummation. 

The escrow depletion was not an unforeseen event ; it was scheduled, known to the lender, and occurred solely because the lender delayed closing, placing the resulting cost increase entirely within the lenders control. 

All communications with the lender occurred on recorded lines, and the lenders own records should reflect its knowledge of the escrow payment, the delays in closing, and the timing of the material change disclosed only hours before the scheduled closing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MD,21771,None,Consent provided,Web,01/13/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18700223

I sent a letter in XXXX, have called no less than XXXX times to discuss this matter with various individuals at the company. It was not until I filed a Better Business Bureau claim on XX/XX/XXXX, against them where they stated, per investor guidelines, escrow deletion is solely based on the original value of the home. This was the first I heard this as the excuse to not remove my escrow account. I have requested these investor guidelines twice, once on XX/XX/XXXX and then again on XX/XX/XXXX. They have still not provided them. I have rejected their statements XXXX times on XXXX for not providing these guidelines and the XXXX has now closed the case. Im seeking the help of the CFPB to actually get these documents they continuously cite as the reason to hold my money hostage in an escrow account. I have also looked through all of their FAQs related to escrow and it make not one mention that they only use the original evaluation in their escrow determinations. This appears to be against consumer guidelines as I can not find these documents on my own anywhere. My home, like most homes, have gained massive equity since I purchased in XXXX.

09/03/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I am submitting this complaint regarding ongoing and systemic issues with Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing that have caused significant financial and personal distress. 

XXXX. Customer Service Failures Shellpoints automated phone system is grossly inadequate. Callers are forced to repeat the same prompts multiple times, often resulting in extended hold times of 3045 minutes before reaching a live representative. This practice makes it nearly impossible to resolve urgent servicing issues in a timely manner. 

XXXX. Escrow Mismanagement & Forced Insurance Shellpoint has charged excessively high escrow amounts and improperly forced insurance coverage on my loan, despite the fact that I already have active and valid insurance through my own provider. My insurance agent submitted proof of coverage to Shellpoint multiple times. Shellpoint later claimed they changed the email address used to receive proof of insurance but never notified me or my insurance broker of this change. All communications from Shellpoint, including escrow notices, listed the original email address. Changing such a critical email address without providing notice to borrowers or insurance providers is highly irresponsible and directly caused unnecessary charges. 

XXXX. Lack of Transparency & Communication No correspondencevia mail, email, or phonewas ever provided to inform me or my agent of the supposed email change. This lack of communication demonstrates a disregard for borrowers rights and directly resulted in unwarranted charges being added to my account. 

XXXX. Widespread Consumer Harm Shellpoint has an alarming number of complaints documented with the Better Business Bureau, Consumer review platforms ( XXXX, XXXX, etc. ), and other consumer protection sites. The recurring themes across these complaints include : Forced-placed insurance despite proof of existing coverage. 

Mishandling of escrow accounts. 

Failure to properly apply payments. 

Excessive fees and penalties. 

Inadequate customer service and communication failures. 

Borrowers placed at risk of foreclosure due to Shellpoints negligence. 

These are not isolated incidents. Borrowers across the country are reporting the same problems, which indicates a systemic failure in Shellpoints servicing practices. People are losing their homes due to Shellpoints lack of accountability, poor communication, and inability to resolve even basic servicing errors.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",LA,70115,None,Consent provided,Web,09/16/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15698841

My escrow account with XXXX XXXX  ( prior servicer ) paid taxes and FHA insurance through XX/XX/year> and had a {$0.00} balance with no refund due. 

This charge appears duplicative, unsupported, and unjustified. 

XXXX ) Incorrect Mortgage Interest Reporting ( 2024 Form 1098 ) : Shellpoint reported {$9100.00} in interest for 2024. 

The payoff statement shows {$2900.00} accrued interest through payoff on XX/XX/year>. 

This discrepancy suggests either an IRS reporting error or overcharge of interest.

I have been making on time payments on said loan since. 

My Payments were set on XXXX to be deducted from the account every month and I kept a reserve of 6 months of payments on that account as travel frequently. 

My loan was sold/transferred to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. I did not know loan was transferred until sometime in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. When I received a Service Members Relief/Exemption form from a Foreclosure attorney from the Law Firm of XXXX & XXXX. 

So I immediately contacted my previous servicer and they informed me to contact XXXX XXXX. So I immediately created a login and went online to try and pay the mortgage as all the back Payments that have not been getting auto deducted were sitting in the bank account. But XXXX XXXX would not let me make the payment online. 

So I immediately called the phone number for XXXX and was told that because a Foreclosure had been started that I wouldn't be able to make the payment online and they would have to get back to me with an adjusted amount to pay before I could resume my normal payments. 

It took the representative approximately XXXX days before calling me back to state the Reinstatement amount would be Approx {$3800.00} more than what the total of the monthly payments should be because of Late Fees, Attorney Fees Etc. 

I would like to reiterate I never received any communication from my Servicer telling me this loan was transferred and that they were not still receiving the XXXX draft payments that I set up. I told them I had no problem paying the required amount of monthly payments but refused to pay the penalty amounts because I was not notified properly of the Loan Transfer! 

Furthermore when I spoke to the XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX I was told they had an incorrect Phone number on file for me that had XXXX of the numbers mismatched. They had no email address for me on file and a wrong mailing address. 

Because of those factors I asked repeatedly to be allowed to make my payments to catch my loan up as was denied on no less than XXXX attempts! 

XXXX XXXX told me he had reached out to the new Investor/Note Holder and informed him or her of the XXXX up to no avail. They didn't care they wanted payment in full with the penalties which I refused again. And I was told they are proceeding with the foreclosure and would not accept my payments. 

XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX also offered me a loan modification in which I told him I did not need because I had the full amount of the Back payments if they would waive the excessive penalty/ foreclosure amount as it was a mistake on their part and not one of my doing! They refused again after again telling me he asked the Note Holder. Who i don't believe is operating in Good Faith or the confines of the law or legal reporting requirements of the State of North Carolina.

In XXXX of XXXX I was again approved for a loss mitigation plan with three trial payments due in XXXX, XXXX an XXXX of XXXX. 
I was also applying for assistance through the state program and was denied a loan on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point I made my first trial payment which had to be paid by the last business day of the month. A bank error caused the payment to not be processed until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I changed my insurance coverage on the property which resulted in my insurance premium being reduced by {$10000.00}. 

On XXXX XXXX I received an attached letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX notifying me that I was eligible for a {$50000.00} grant for reinstatement, but that they could not apply the funds unless I made payment of approximately {$22000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. Instead they wanted to apply the amount to the unpaid principal balance once i signed the loan modification. This amount could either be forwarded to the mortgage company or paid to the XXXX directly. I expressed my intent to reinstate to one XXXX XXXX and informed her that I believed the amount stated as due through XX/XX/XXXX was invalid as it did not contemplate my updated escrow amount nor the payment for XXXX. 

I borrowed the funds from my parents because the reinstatement was a much better option as the incomplete loan modification would result in my mortgage with a rate of 3.1 % and a monthly payment of approximately {$2600.00} raising to an interest rate of 7.5 % with a monthly payment of nearly {$6200.00} as my once deferred principal balance would now be due. I sent proof of my payment and insurance change to XXXX and they reached out to the XXXX coordinator XXXX XXXX at Shellpoint New Rez several times requesting an updated amount. XXXX XXXX 's responses were forwarded to me that she was waiting on a response from loss mitigation. 

Because a sale was scheduled, the XXXX representatives advised me to pay the trial payment while they awaited a response. 
I raised several inquiries and received several different responses. As of XX/XX/XXXX when I was due to make the payment XXXX had failed to receive a response from Shellpoint/New Rez ; therefore, the XXXX was unable to process the payment. 
I called and began escalation on XX/XX/XXXX with Shellpoint at which point my single point of Contact ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) advised that the state would not issue the funds or allow a reinstatement and that I was not able to make the supplement payment but would have to go through with an unsigned loss mitigation and that this came directly from the state. The company also provided two different reinstatement amounts one in the amount of {$72000.00} and one in the amount of {$51000.00}. On both estimates, shellpoint included pre-paid escrows which under the terms of my mortgage were not yet due in the amount for reinstatement ; however in the reinstatement. 

I notified the mortgagor 's attorney of this discrepancy and they provided another amount {$66000.00} due through XX/XX/XXXX As I had not made the XXXX trial payment this would require me to pay the {$6200.00} to the XXXX along with another {$10000.00} which I borrowed from my parents resulting in preserving my rate and keeping my home affordable.

The demand outlined {$12000.00} in unapplied funds and referenced recorded admissions by company representatives acknowledging the misapplication. I attached call transcripts, payment screenshots, and citations to federal statutes. 

The email was sent directly to multiple compliance officers at NewRez and XXXX  XXXX XXXX with copies to CFPB Enforcement, DOJ Civil Fraud, FTC, and VA Oversight ( see attached transmission proof ).

Summary for CFPB Review This complaint establishes a clear statutory violation of RESPA 2605 ( e ) and a pattern of predatory servicing practices against a XXXX veteran borrower. The companys continued misrepresentation and failure to apply funds constitute willful non Corporate Connection Between XXXX XXXX and NewRez LLC According to public filings with the XXXX Securities and Exchange Commission, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX : XXXX  ) explicitly identifies NewRez LLCoperating under the trade name Shellpoint Mortgage Servicingas a wholly owned subsidiary and core revenue-producing segment. In XXXX most recent Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, the company reports mortgage-servicing income, origination fees, and interest spread revenue derived directly from NewRezs operations. Those same filings list XXXX XXXX ( Chairman & CEO ) and XXXX XXXX ( CFO ) as certifying officers under SarbanesOxley Act 302 and 906, attesting that the financial statements fairly present in all material respects the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, including NewRez LLC. XXXX consolidated balance sheet, footnotes, and management discussion further confirm that NewRezs servicing rights, advances, and custodial accounts are recorded as XXXX assets under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and materially affect shareholder earnings. 

Therefore, any representation to regulators or consumers that XXXX is not the appropriate company or has no connection to NewRez LLC is demonstrably false. Such statements constitute potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001 ( False Statements ), 15 U.S.C. 78j ( b ) and 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5 ( Securities Fraud ), as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), which prohibits deceptive acts in the offering or administration of consumer-financial services. The inclusion of XXXX own SEC-filed 10-Q and 8-K exhibits establishes irrefutable proof of the parent-subsidiary relationship and the flow of financial benefit from NewRezs servicing activity directly to XXXX XXXX and its shareholders.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/05/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17040608

After three days, I called again, they told me to wait. I waited a few more days and I called again and told them, whether you are ready or not, let me create an auto debit account so you may take the mortgage payment on the third of every month after this first payment. They received the first payment on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX # XXXX ; Amount : {$1400.00} : Confirmation : XXXX and continued to debit my bank account on the third of every month.

I called them and said that my payments are always deducted on time and never been late, then I said that I have the proof. Now, the lady put me on hold, came in 10 to 15 minutes to ask for more time to investigate and she will call me back. She never call back so I decided to call back the next day. Another lady answered and told me, yes your account is past due, I told her this is not accurate, I have all my bank statements to prove that shellpoint always take the money from my account on the third of every month. She said okay, give a few minutes to investigate this matter. She came back and told me she sees that my payments are always received on time but they realized that I was not paying enough the past months, she is going to investigate a little bit more and call me back. Again, no one call back, while they do not call back, they sent a bunch of emails, asking me to fill up a survey ( How likely is it that I will recommend to other people ) I call again, the same, yes sir you mortgage payment is past due but when I said that I have proof that my payments are always on time, again give me some time to investigate, again, please give me more time and I will call you, nobody called back then I decided to make a last call, I found a Man, he was very kind and took his time to listen however, I realized he was scared of something though he gave all the same answered I had received before.

09/11/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","This complaint is in response to XXXX  submitted on XX/XX/year>, which you closed before I could respond to the companys response. Here is my response to the company : Your most recent letter ( in quotes ) to the Department of Financial Institutions, my replies beneath each of the quoted portions : An inspection was ordered on XX/XX/year>, but was not scheduled or completed until XX/XX/year>. A final draw request was submitted on XX/XX/year> ; however, it could not be processed due to the contractors incorrect completion of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). There is no record indicating that XXXX informed XXXX XXXX of this delay. 

That is half correct. We went back and forth two or three times on that waiver, but a corrected copy was accepted on the insurance portal on XX/XX/XXXX ( screenshot of insurance portal available ) and NEVER once were we told by ANYONE that the AMOUNT on the XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX was incorrect. Also, I was not told that a final draw request had been made. XX/XX/XXXX was the date the one and only inspection was uploaded to the portal. 

FYI, the mistake with the amount on the XXXX doesnt change the total amount of money going out and I can ASSURE you, that if I had received the check and confirmed with the contractor his portion, he would have been overnighted his correct payment.

OK, lets do the math and revise the numbers I originally gave you : Contractors Estimate : {$6600.00} XXXX XXXX ( first payment ) = {$4200.00} still owed to contractor. 
{$9300.00} ( original claim check ) XXXX ( 1st Payment ) = {$7000.00} = amount remaining in restricted escrow account this is the same total remaining amount weve been talking about since the beginning. 
{$7000.00} - {$4200.00} still owed to contractor = {$2700.00} balance to me. 
{$4200.00} + {$2300.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX {$9300.00} ( original claim check amount ) Shellpoint acknowledges XXXX XXXX statement regarding the conditional nature of the flooring XXXX. However, the issue stemmed from the contractor entering the previously paid amount rather than the outstanding balance. 

Why am I just hearing about this now for the first time ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Why didnt anybody say that the AMOUNT was wrong on that form? Why didnt XXXX XXXX tell me that the amount was wrong? THE FLOORING CONTRACTORS XXXX WAS UPLOADED AND ACCEPTED ON THE INSURANCE PORTAL ON XX/XX/XXXX. WHY WAS IT ACCEPTED ON THE INSURANCE PORTAL IF IT WAS INCORRECT? 

Additionally, although XXXX XXXX  were completed prior to Shellpoint receiving the insurance proceeds, the required documentation was still pending. 

NOT IT WAS NOT, as I have demonstrated in the emails ( email chain available ). They received the estimate on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX docusigned on XX/XX/XXXX and received by XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX at the latest, and per XXXX XXXX, a XXXX was not required, as this contractor HAD been paid. 

A foreclosure sale for the property was held on XX/XX/year>. The property did not sell at auction and subsequently reverted to lender ownership as XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). As of the foreclosure sale date, the remaining loss draft balance was {$7000.00}. At that time, the Claims Department was awaiting the contractors XXXX proposal, the XXXX, and a completed XXXX form. 

AGAIN, THIS IS FALSE. See previous reply. 

On XX/XX/year>, the Claims Department contacted the contractor and resubmitted the draw request. That same day, they requested the contractors proposal and XXXX  related to the XXXX  XXXX  noted in the Adjusters report. There is no record of this communication being shared with the borrower. 

CORRECT. I did not receive the communication regarding re-submitting the draw request. As far as I knew, it had never been submitted at all. It does seem like the borrower should be kept in the loop. Why were we rushing around trying to get the XXXX  info when the XXXX XXXX was in danger of not being paid at all? And did you know at this time that the XXXX had the incorrect amount on it? Did you ask the XXXX to re-submit the form WITH THE CORRECT AMOUNT the actual true balance and not the initial payment made? Or did you just ask him to re-submit, as if you hadnt received it, expecting him to just figure out the problem? Let this be a reminder that the clients you work with are NOT LICENSED IN INSURANCE. If it was going to result in this insurance payment being stolen by Shellpoint, I think I should have been informed and included on the email chain. 

Based on available information, it appears XXXX XXXX was attempting to obtain the necessary documentation from a different contractor. 

What are you even talking about? I WAS ATTEMPTING TO OBTAIN PAPERWORK FROM THE XXXX XXXXXXXX BECAUSE THATS WHAT XXXX XXXX TOLD US HE NEEDED. WHY WERE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE XXXX XXXXXXXX, WHO HAD BEEN PAID, RATHER THAN THE FLOORING XXXX, WHO HAD NOT BEEN PAID, AND WHOSE FORM WAS APPARENTLY NOT CORRECT? Why was an incorrect form accepted in the insurance portal on XX/XX/XXXX? As per my previous letter to you, on Thu, XX/XX/year>, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX wrote : Hello, I have everything cleared for the final payment for the flooring work. There is an entry on the adjusters estimate foXXXX XXXX work and this is also mention in the email chain that this is complete. We need to know who did the work, get the proposal for this work, the waiver of lien for them, know if they have been paid, and if not we will need their XXXX. Thank you ( actual email available ). 

He said nothing whatsoever in that email about correcting the amount on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but he DID say that everything was cleared for payment to the flooring XXXX. Hmmmm. It looks like you need to pay me and XXXX XXXX XXXX what is owed, and then get your money back from XXXX XXXX XXXX or the investor or the bank or the lender or whoever the heck has it. 

However, the property transitioned to XXXX status on XX/XX/year>, and was no longer managed by the Claims Department. Once a loan becomes XXXX, any remaining loss draft funds are typically held and remitted to the investor to offset losses incurred from the foreclosure. 

This is not what you said in your previous letter. In that letter, you said that the money goes to the bank holding the XXXX, not a private investor and not that it could be spent on foreclosure costs. Also, you are admitting here that the property did not transition to XXXX status until XX/XX/year>, fully four days after the XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX a.m. email to XXXX XXXX containing the XXXX docusigned on XX/XX/XXXX from the XXXX company. 

Newrez/Shellpoint never had any intention of disbursing this money, otherwise they would have called our attention to the fact that the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX had the wrong amount on it on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX weeks before the auction sale and with PLENTY OF TIME to make the appropriate correction. That would also have been a good time for XXXX XXXX to review the file and ask for the missing XXXX  paperwork. 

Does anyone at your company READ anything? Do they READ emails? Do they CHECK things before the due date? This is like dealing with an XXXX old. 

I most certainly will be investigating the possibility of a lawsuit. 

All I want is {$4200.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX and the {$2700.00} balance to me still the same {$7000.00} weve been talking about since XX/XX/XXXX, when the floor was finished. The lawyers can have whatever they can get above that and I hope they take you to the cleaners.

10/27/25,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I have been a homeowner for 26 years and have always intended to remain current on my mortgage. Unfortunately, beginning in XXXX, I experienced a series of serious and uncontrollable hardships : In XXXX, I contracted XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was in a major car accident, which required an extended recovery period. I notified my mortgage servicer, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, after each event and asked for temporary assistance options. However, after notifying them of my XXXX accident, months went by without any follow-up or resolution from Shellpoint. I received no communication or support until I again reached out. I also filed an FHA complaint about the lack of communication and my mortgage company not following up. 
Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, while I was still recovering, I was in another serious car accident ( a hit-and-run ) that caused significant injuries, including surgeries, and extended medical treatment. These events left me unable to maintain regular payments, but I stayed in contact with Shellpoint and made every effort to find a solution. 
Shellpoint first offered me a three-month repayment plan, which was too short given my medical condition. When I asked for a longer plan, I was told it was not available. Instead, I was offered a 40-year mortgage modification, raising my interest rate from 4 % to 6.75 %, which made no financial sense since I have already paid on my home for over two decades. I contacted FHA, who told me I should qualify for a 6-month repayment plan. I was granted that plan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that a down payment was required to start that plan. This was information that remember Shellpoint had informed me of earlier. ( I reported this as well ). When I spoke to a Shellpoint representative, she assured me that the down payment could simply be added into the repayment plan. I requested it to be added in when she called me back. However, when I called in on XX/XX/XXXX to make my first payment, I was told the plan had been canceled for failure to make that down payment. I was devastated! This confusion and lack of clear communication caused my account to fall further behind. I continued to request reasonable assistance ( a12-month repayment plan or a forbearance for medical ), but Shellpoint told me since it was the 13 month, they could not assist me and proceeded to offer the 40 year modification again. I was baffled because they had so many months prior, to help set me up the 12-mnth. 
Afterwards, My mortgage company point of contact said new options were coming but then later told me I still only qualified for the same 40-year plan. During the government shutdown, I have been unable to reach FHA or HUD for clarification or to escalate my concerns. There is no middle ground. Despite this, Shellpoint has proceeded with foreclosure activity. 
I recently called Shellpoint again to report their inconsistencies and misleading information that I have been receiving. I filed a report with them just last week, explaining that : -Several agents gave me different and contradictory information, -Some failed to return calls or refused to give me more detail information about my account and options. I this complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, no one has contacted me. 
Here are my concerns : 1. Poor communication and follow-up : Shellpoint failed to respond for months after my initial hardship report and has not followed through on promised callbacks. 
2. Conflicting information : Representatives gave inconsistent details about repayment options and down payment requirements. 
3. Lack of transparency : I was not informed of key repayment terms in time to comply.

4. Unreasonable modification offer : The 40-year modification raises my rate from 4 % to 6.75 % after 26 years of payments, which is not fair or appropriate for a medical hardship case.

5. Foreclosure despite ongoing communication : Shellpoint advanced toward foreclosure even though I was actively seeking resolution. 
6. No response to internal complaint : My formal complaint to Shellpoint has not been addressed, and supervisors have not followed up.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",GA,30008,None,Consent provided,Web,10/27/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16843893

Timeline of Key Events XX/XX/XXXX ( date I later learned ) The mortgage servicer paid the municipal trash/sewer balance ( I was not aware at the time and was not notified in advance ). 
Early XXXX ( prior to XX/XX/XXXX ) I received notice that my property was at risk of sheriff sale unless approximately {$6000.00} was paid immediately. I contacted XXXX right away to resolve the issue. 
XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my first payment under the XXXX payment arrangement. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX to confirm my payment/arrangement status. XXXX informed me the balance was paid in full.

XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my mortgage account and saw the escrow shortage/payment increase notice. 
My monthly payment increased from {$840.00} to {$2100.00} due to the escrow shortage created by the servicers advance. 



Key Issues I was not notified in advance that the servicer intended to pay the municipal bill. 
The amount required to stop the sheriff sale was about {$6000.00}, but the servicer paid the entire multi-year balance, which caused a major escrow shock.

RE : Complaints # XXXX & # XXXX - FORMAL DISSATISFACTION & DEMAND FOR ESCALATION TO ENFORCEMENT CONSUMER : XXXX XXXX XXXX ADDRESS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX CA XXXX FORECLOSURE SALE XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX - 31 days as of XX/XX/XXXX CONTACT : XXXX | XXXX SUBJECT : CFPB Improper "" Duplicate '' Marking - Procedural Obstruction of Emergency Enforcement TO : XXXX XXXX XXXX, CFPB Office of Enforcement EMERGENCY SITUATION : 31 days until XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure sale CFPB PROCEDURAL OBSTRUCTION VIOLATES AGENCY GUIDELINES The CFPB 's marking of XXXX # XXXX ( against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, filed XX/XX/XXXX ) as a "" duplicate '' of # XXXX ( against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, filed earlier ) constitutes procedural obstruction of emergency enforcement. This violates CFPB 's own guidelines on independent complaint processing, which reserve duplicate markings for identical issues submitted by or on behalf of the same consumer against the same entity, not distinct violations across separate regulated companies. This also breaches 12 C.F.R. Section 1024.35 requirements for error resolution. 

These complaints are fundamentally and legally distinct : Different regulated entities : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( mortgage servicer ) vs. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( indenture trustee ) Different federal violations : Shellpoint 's RESPA Section 2605 ( e ) servicing errors, including predatory reinstatement quotes inflating deficits to {$590000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, improper fees ( {$2500.00} legal fees and {$970.00} inspection charges ), and failure to validate debt under FDCPA Section 1692g despite XX/XX/XXXX certified mail requests vs. XXXX 's trustee fiduciary breaches under federal securities law Different legal theories : Shellpoint 's dual tracking and California Civil Code Section 2924c violations vs. XXXXXXXX XXXX indenture trustee duties under XXXX XXXX XXXX and Investment Company Act fiduciary standards This improper marking obstructs time-sensitive consumer protection for a XXXX XXXX homeowner surviving on {$1300.00} monthly Social Security, enabling illegal foreclosure despite documented federal and state violations. The CFPB 's procedural error creates potential agency liability under the Administrative Procedure Act for arbitrary and capricious action. 

SYSTEMATIC DELAY COORDINATION ENABLED BY CFPB INACTION The "" duplicate '' marking occurred XX/XX/XXXX, the same day I submitted feedback demanding director-level intervention after a CFPB representative claimed the Bureau "" can't do much. '' This statement directly contradicts CFPB 's enforcement authority under 12 U.S.C. Section 5564 and suggests bias, inadequate training, or procedural error requiring immediate supervisory review. 

This CFPB procedural obstruction enables a coordinated delay strategy across the entire securitization chain : - Shellpoint deflected to New Residential while ignoring systemic name fraud using "" XXXX '' despite XXXX court order, violating FDCPA Section 1692e - New Residential deflects to Caliber - Caliber deflects to XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX deflects to XXXX - XXXX deflects to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX - CFPB marks legitimate complaints as "" duplicates, '' preventing mandatory company responses and regulatory resolution This coordinated buck-passing targeting a vulnerable XXXX XXXX consumer on limited Social Security income constitutes systematic elder financial abuse. This is bordering on elder abuse, and this must cease and desist immediately. 

EXTRAORDINARY PAYMENT HISTORY DEMONSTRATES GOOD FAITH I have paid approximately {$1.00} XXXX over 19 years on a {$1.00} XXXX loan, with principal balance confirmed at {>= $1,000,000} as of XX/XX/XXXX. This exceptional 84 % payment performance over nearly two decades should preclude foreclosure under any reasonable servicing standard. This payment history, combined with predatory reinstatement quotes inflating deficits and deliberate silence on validation requests, renders the XX/XX/XXXX sale unconscionable and constitutes systematic elder financial abuse. 

DOCUMENTED FEDERAL VIOLATIONS REQUIRING EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT This case involves systematic violations across multiple federal statutes requiring immediate CFPB enforcement action : FDCPA Sections 1692e and 1692g Violations : Persistent use of "" XXXX '' identification constituting identity fraud that prevents effective consumer defense, combined with deliberate silence on XX/XX/XXXX debt validation requests while proceeding with collection and foreclosure activities. This mirrors predatory collection practices targeting elderly consumers. 

RESPA Section 2605 ( e ) Dual Tracking Violations : Advancing foreclosure sale amid pending error resolution disputes while providing inaccurate reinstatement quotes that exclude XXXX payment of {$15000.00} and artificially inflate deficit amounts to deny statutory reinstatement rights under California Civil Code Section 2924c. 

Elder Financial Abuse under California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 15610.30 : Coordinated delay tactics and buck-passing across entities designed to exploit the vulnerability of a XXXXXXXX XXXX citizen on fixed Social Security income , warranting treble damages under Section 15657.5. 

Federal Securities Law Violations : XXXX 's deflection ignores non-delegable fiduciary duties as indenture trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX, enabling the predatory servicing scheme in violation of Investment Company Act standards and SEC oversight requirements. 

California Civil Code Section 2924c Violations : Weaponized reinstatement calculations designed to deny statutory reinstatement rights through inflated and inaccurate figures that exclude legitimate payments and add unauthorized fees. 

DEMAND FOR EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT ACTION WITHIN 24 HOURS Pursuant to CFPB 's emergency enforcement authority under 12 U.S.C. Sections 5564 ( a ) and 5531, I demand the following immediate actions within 24 hours of receipt ( by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) : 1. Immediate removal of improper "" duplicate '' marking from Complaint # XXXX with supervisory review of the staff member responsible 2. Separate expedited processing of both complaints with mandatory company responses within 15 business days under emergency timeline 3. Emergency cease-and-desist order halting the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure sale pending full investigation of documented federal violations 4. Internal investigation into CFPB staff handling of these time-sensitive complaints and the statement that the Bureau "" can't do much '' regarding clear federal violations 5. Immediate referral to CFPB Enforcement Division for civil penalty proceedings against all violating entities for systematic elder financial abuse and coordinated FDCPA/RESPA violations 6. Coordination with California DFPI and Attorney General for parallel state enforcement action given the elder abuse component FORMAL REJECTION OF SYSTEMATIC DEFLECTION RESPONSES XXXXXXXX XXXX deflection to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ignores fundamental legal principles governing indenture trustee responsibilities. Their response fails to address : - Non-delegable fiduciary duties under the XXXX XXXX XXXX indenture agreement - Statutory authority to halt foreclosure proceedings amid documented chain-of-title defects and servicer violations- Fiduciary obligations to both certificate holders and borrowers under federal securities law - The 31-day emergency timeline requiring immediate trustee intervention to prevent irreparable harm - Elder abuse implications of coordinated delay tactics targeting vulnerable consumers Similarly, Shellpoint 's deflection to New Residential while continuing to use fraudulent "" XXXX '' identification violates both FDCPA Section 1692e and elder protection statutes by deliberately preventing effective consumer defense during the critical pre-foreclosure period. 

COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-CHANNEL ESCALATION INITIATED This matter is being simultaneously forwarded to investigate CFPB 's failure to enforce statutory consumer protection duties and prevent systematic elder financial abuse : Federal Level : - CFPB Director XXXX XXXX and Enforcement Division - Senate Banking Committee XXXX XXXX XXXX and Ranking Member XXXX XXXX XXXX House Financial Services Committee Chairman XXXX XXXX and Ranking Member XXXX XXXX - CFPB Office of Inspector General for procedural violations and potential bias - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Ombudsman State Level : - California Attorney General XXXX XXXX Elder Abuse Unit - California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation - California Department of Aging Elder Abuse Prevention Program Consumer Advocacy and Media : - National Consumer Law Center - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Local and national media outlets covering elder financial abuse and regulatory failure The coordinated nature of these violations across multiple CFPB-regulated entities, combined with the Bureau 's procedural obstruction through improper duplicate marking, demonstrates systemic failure in consumer protection that requires immediate congressional oversight and public accountability. The elder abuse component makes this case particularly egregious and appropriate for comprehensive media coverage. 

LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUED CFPB INACTION Should the CFPB fail to take emergency enforcement action within the demanded 24-hour timeframe ( by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ), this procedural obstruction and regulatory failure will be included in subsequent federal litigation as evidence of : - Administrative Procedure Act violations through arbitrary and capricious agency action - Failure to enforce statutory consumer protection mandates under the Dodd-Frank Act - Enabling of elder financial abuse through improper case handling - Potential agency bias or inadequate staff training requiring oversight intervention The documented pattern of federal law violations, if allowed to proceed to illegal foreclosure sale, will result in comprehensive litigation against all entities in the securitization chain with CFPB 's procedural failures and enforcement abdication as primary evidence of systematic regulatory breakdown and potential agency liability. 

Additionally, this case will serve as precedent for challenging CFPB 's improper use of "" duplicate '' markings to obstruct legitimate consumer complaints involving distinct entities and violations, requiring policy reform and staff retraining. 

STATUS : FORMAL DISSATISFACTION - EMERGENCY ESCALATION ACTIVE ACROSS ALL CHANNELS Time remaining until illegal foreclosure : 31 days as of XX/XX/XXXX CFPB emergency response window demanded : 24 hours ( by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) Escalation status : Active across federal, state, advocacy, and media channels Elder abuse reporting : Initiated with appropriate state and federal agencies Congressional notification : Pending CFPB response timeline Media outreach : Prepared for immediate release upon CFPB inaction This emergency situation requires immediate CFPB enforcement action to prevent irreparable harm to a vulnerable consumer through illegal foreclosure proceedings enabled by systematic federal law violations. The documented pattern of FDCPA, RESPA, and securities law violations, combined with CFPB 's procedural obstruction and staff statements minimizing agency authority, creates comprehensive liability for both the regulated entities and potentially the Bureau itself if this foreclosure proceeds without proper emergency enforcement intervention. 

The CFPB 's mission to protect consumers, particularly vulnerable populations like elderly and XXXX Americans, is being undermined by procedural obstruction and inadequate enforcement response. Immediate director-level intervention is required to restore agency credibility and prevent systematic elder financial abuse.

They continued to advise they needed additional documentation from probate proving I am the sole heir, and when I provided the documentation I thought they needed ( several times, over multiple months ) they refused to advise that the documentation was not what they were asking for or would flat out tell me Im not sure it goes to a different department. 

We fell upon financial struggle that put us behind and an impending foreclosure date was provided earlier this year. I worked with someone who helped put the loan in forbearance, and advised I could then apply for a repayment plan or a modification. Once the two month forbearance was over, she reached out to gain additional information to move forward with an application for the modification. I provided all necessary information, and was not advised I was missing anything until I CCd her on an email to the loss mitigation department with the full list of documents requested. She then emailed me and advised she was no longer my point of contact and to call the XXXX number to reapply and be reappointed a new single point of contact. 

There was no further explanation, so I called and reapplied. Still, I was not advised that I had been denied for the modification, nor why ( that one document was missing and I didnt realize ). I was told 5-7 business days to be assigned a POC, and nothing could be done until I was contacted by that POC. I waited 5 business days days, called, and was advised that there was no updates yet. I called again the following Monday to be told that I was not eligible as I did not provide the correct documentation. Instead of reaching out to let me know so that I could make the easy fix needed, they waited for me to reach out despite that I was advised the opposite. 

In the last year I have called and discussed my options at least 20+ times with someone over the phone, as well as daily/ weekly communication via email. This entire time I was under the impression that we were working toward a loan modification application, when in reality they were giving me the run around and I feel as if this was their intention all along.

Original VA loan number : XXXX New VA loan number : XXXX Throughout the refinance process, I was explicitly instructed not to make my XX/XX/year> mortgage payment by both the loan officer, XXXX XXXX, and the processor, XXXX XXXX, on multiple recorded/advised calls on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/year>. I followed their directions in good faith. Because the old loans grace period ended on XX/XX/year>, and the refinance did not fund/disburse until XX/XX/year>, the servicer assessed {$66.00} in late fees and additional interest. On XX/XX/year>, when I contacted customer service to inquire about my remaining escrow balance from the old loan, I was informed that this {$66.00} late charge had already been deducted from my expected escrow refund. I was further told that this is company policy, that the collections/customer service department does not communicate with the refinance/loan department, that I have no recourse, and that there is nothing I can do to dispute or remove the fee.

This late charge is improper and constitutes a servicing error under RESPA ( 12 CFR 1024.35 ) because : - The delinquency was caused solely by following the explicit, repeated instructions of the lenders own employees during a XXXX XXXXXXXX transaction. 
- XXXX XXXX  refinances routinely defer the payment for the month of closing without penalty to the veteran. 

- The imposition of late fees caused by the servicers own refinance process or miscommunication between its departments constitutes a servicing error ( incorrectly imposed fees ).

10/01/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Re : XXXX XXXX Demand & RESPA Notice Unfair and Deceptive Mortgage Servicing Practices To Whom It May Concern : I am the borrower on the mortgage loan secured by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am writing pursuant to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to demand relief for unfair and deceptive acts committed by NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint ) in connection with servicing this loan. The XXXX XXXX Notice dated XX/XX/XXXX, identifies factual inaccuracies and omissions. 

Facts Shellpoint received preservation payments that were recognized in my bankruptcy proceedings in from XXXX through XXXX yet continues to assert I defaulted inclusive of this period. 
Shellpoint withheld a required appraisal for approximately XXXX  months before negotiating loss mitigation, in violation of federal servicing standards and industry duties of good faith. 
Shellpoint offered a conditional modification/settlement of $ XXXX that I accepted but they failed to honor. 

Per the XXXX Right-To-Cure notification, there is {$1700.00} as an unapplied balance, further evidence of misapplied preservation payments and other accounting issues. 
Shellpoint referred my loan to outside counsel ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to collect on disputed amounts, misrepresenting my account status. This notice is defective because it implies personal liability on a discharged debt in violation of Bankruptcy Code - Discharge Injunction Violation ( 11 U.S.C. 524 ( a ) ).

Key Errors in Shellpoints Right to Cure Notice 1. 1 ) Failure to account for courtapproved preservation payments. 
I made preservation payments in the amount of {$2300.00} per month from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX pursuant to orders entered in my bankruptcy case. Your Right to Cure Notice asserts nonpayment of every monthly installment from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. By ignoring XXXX years of preservation payments recognized by the bankruptcy court, the Notice materially overstates the arrears and is misleading. 
XXXX. XXXX ) Servicing transfer/recordkeeping deficiency. 
Shellpoint requested I supply proof of the XXXX payments because it did not have the complete prior servicers history ( See enclosures : Years XXXX and XXXX are missing in their entirety ). After I directed Shellpoint to the bankruptcy court docket, Shellpoint still forwarded inaccurate loan histories and noticed default for the entire period. This demonstrates a failure to maintain accurate loan records following a servicing transfer and to conduct a reasonable investigation of my dispute. 

XXXX. XXXX ) Escrow and unapplied funds discrepancies. 
The Notice reflects multiple stepups in escrow amounts and an unapplied balance of ( {$1700.00} ) held in suspense. Shellpoint has not explained why those funds were not applied to reduce arrears or principal. Without a contemporaneous escrow analysis and a full suspense account history, Shellpoint can not lawfully demand inflated arrears or declare default based on amounts not actually due. 

Errors Under Massachusetts and Federal Law Massachusetts law ( G.L. c. XXXX, XXXX ) requires strict compliance with default/Right to Cure requirements ; misstated or misleading arrears figures render a notice defective. Further, federal servicing regulations require accurate account maintenance, timely investigation and response to borrower disputes, and goodfaith lossmitigation handling. As with XXXX XXXX XXXX Shellpoint in XXXX for mishandled servicing & foreclosure practices, there is already precedent for misconduct. 

Violations Unfair and deceptive acts under XXXX. XXXX XXXX, c and XXXX ; Violations of 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( RESPA ) and 12 C.F.R. 1024.35, 1024.36 ; and 1024.41 ; Violations of 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( servicing policies and procedures ) ; Bad faith conduct similar to conduct found unlawful in the XXXX XXXX Attorney Generals settlement with Shellpoint. 

Demand for Immediate Action Provide a written correction and reconciliation of my account that credits all preservation payments made between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; Produce a complete payment history/transaction ledger from XX/XX/XXXX to present, including suspense account activity, unapplied funds, and application dates ; Produce all lossmitigation logs and the appraisal order/receipt timeline, along with all communications with prior servicers ; Provide escrow analyses supporting each escrow amount reflected in the Right to Cure Notice and correct any overcharges ; Issue a corrected Right to Cure Notice, if Shellpoint continues to contend a default exists, reflecting accurate arrears and dates ; Cease any foreclosure activity and collection efforts based on inaccurate figures until the above corrections are completed. 

Response Deadline This is both a XXXX XXXXXXXX demand and a RESPA Notice of Error/Request for Information. Please provide a written response within 30 days under XXXX XXXX and within the timelines specified by 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 and 1024.36. Failure to timely correct and respond will result in the pursuit of all remedies, including suit for damages, attorneys fees, and multiple damages for willful violations.

09/05/25,Debt or credit management,Mortgage modification or foreclosure avoidance,Didn't provide services promised,None,"In XXXX XXXX, Shellpoint unexpectedly contacted my then-boyfriends phone number, stating I was past due after transferring to their company ( I was unaware of this at this time ) and discussing information without my consent. When I contacted Shellpoint to clarify, they were unable to verify my identity because, although my name, address, and date of birth matched, the Social Security number linked to the account was not mine. One of the agents of Shellpoint had even told me the last 4 digits of the social security number that was linked to my account during one of my interactions I had when trying to resolve my account. 

XX/XX/XXXX : While attempting to set up online access, I discovered that entering my Social Security number on the find my account tool on their website and also giving my zip code, it pulled up the account to a couple with the same last name and same city as me. Their last 4 of account number, policy number and company to their insurance, their full names, and address information was shown and it was linked to my social I had input in the find my account tool. 
This meant Shellpoint had incorrectly linked my Social Security number to another borrowers mortgage account, while simultaneously assigning a different Social Security number to my account. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, after I filed a complaint with the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, Shellpoint acknowledged updating my Social Security number but dismissed the seriousness of the matter, stating they saw nothing else wrong. 

This mishandling represents a major privacy and compliance failure, exposing both my identity and another households private mortgage information and social. 


Separately, Shellpoint engaged in deceptive and unprofessional servicing of my account : XX/XX/XXXX : A trial modification offer was posted to my Shellpoint portal. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received an email from XXXX XXXX confirming approval for a trial plan leading to a permanent modification. 

I successfully made the required trial payments ( in fact, four payments instead of the three required ). 

I was told by the loss mitigation team via phone on XX/XX/XXXX, that I would receive documents by mail within 23 weeks to finalize the modification. 

These documents never arrived. Instead : XX/XX/XXXX : My portal showed that the loan assistance plan was no longer being offered. 

XX/XX/XXXX, onward : I repeatedly contacted Shellpoint to resolve the issue and attempt to make monthly payments. I was told only the Loss Mitigation Team could assist me, but each time agents attempted to transfer my call, they were unable to reach anyone. Several agents on different occasions tried to connect me, but no one from Loss Mitigation ever picked up. I was repeatedly promised callbacks that never occurred, leaving me unable to make my required payments. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a letter by mail claiming my account was past due $ $ $ ( subject to additional interest and fees ) and assigning me a single point of contact. 
However, that contact was never available and never returned messages. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Out of desperation, I reapplied for assistance through the portal, submitting a new application and supporting documents. 

XXXX XXXX : Despite repeated calls, no one from the Loss Mitigation Team contacted me. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I finally received a portal message stating that my modification was retracted because the investor declined to participate, citing the end of the HAMP program. This directly contradicted the trial modification I had already completed and was told I would be finalizing.

Shellpoints conduct constitutes multiple violations of OAR 137-020-0805 : 1. Subsection ( 3 ) Misrepresentation : I was told I was approved for a modification, made trial payments, and was promised finalization documents. Instead, the plan was rescinded without notice or justification. 

2. Subsection ( 6 ) Failure to deal in good faith : Agents acknowledged the urgency of my case but consistently failed to connect me to the Loss Mitigation Team or provide promised callbacks.

3. Subsection ( 5 ) Failure to comply with RESPA : Shellpoint failed to provide timely, accurate, and complete servicing information, leaving me unable to make payments or resolve my account. 

4. Privacy violations : Shellpoint mishandled sensitive borrower information by incorrectly linking Social Security numbers, exposing my identity and another couples mortgage information and social.

I have been unfairly placed at risk of foreclosure despite complying with Shellpoints trial plan.

My credit and financial security have been jeopardized. 

My personal identity and Social Security number were mishandled, exposing me to potential fraud and privacy violations. 

The stress, anxiety, and uncertainty caused by Shellpoints conduct have affected not only me, but also my family members residing on the property.

Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing has engaged in deceptive servicing, failed to deal in good faith, and mishandled sensitive borrower information in violation of Oregon law, federal RESPA requirements, and borrower privacy protections. 

Given the seriousness of these violations, I request immediate relief. 

In addition to this complaint filed I will be filing a complaint with the Oregon Department of Justice - Consumer Protection Section to request they take requested action towards this matter and ensure that Shellpoint / New Rez doesnt continue to do this to others too!

ODJ Requested Actions : Investigate Shellpoint/NewRez for unlawful debt collection and deceptive trade practices.

Newrez overpaid my property taxes due to your own servicing error, which caused an escrow shortage. Despite acknowledging that this error originated with Newrez, my monthly mortgage payment was improperly increased to offset the shortage rather than correcting the mistake. 

My county issued a refund check, which Newrez cashed on XX/XX/XXXX.

My mortgage account was with Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. 

After discharge, I entered into a loan modification agreement with Shellpoint / NewRez, which created a new binding contract and enforceable obligation. I have been making all payments on time under this new agreement. 
However, Shellpoint / NewRez refuses to report my mortgage account to the credit bureaus. In a written letter, they stated that I must obtain a reaffirmation of the debt from the court, which is not possible, because reaffirmation agreements must be filed and approved before discharge. Asking me to do something legally impossible is unreasonable and unfair.

12/04/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"am filing a complaint regarding repeated errors by Newrez LLC in setting up and processing my mortgage payment. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, Newrez has incorrectly entered my bank account information several times, causing payment rejections and unnecessary disruption. 

Chronology of events : XX/XX/year> : I received the welcome packet from Newrez. The same day, I created my online account and set up a recurring monthly mortgage payment. 

XX/XX/year> : I received an email from Newrez stating that my recurring payment had been canceled. I immediately logged in and re-established the recurring payment. I received a confirmation email showing it was successfully set up. 

XX/XX/year> : I received notice that the payment was rejected again. 

XX/XX/year> : I called Newrez customer service to determine the cause. The representative read the bank account number they had on file, and it included an extra digit, making it an invalid account number. The representative told me that I must have entered it incorrectly. I accepted responsibility at the time, and she stated the issue was fixed. 

XX/XX/year> ( approximately one hour later ) : Because I no longer trusted the information, I called back. I asked a different representative to read the bank account number on file. To my surprise, the account number was still incorrect, with the same extra digit. The first representative had not corrected the problem, and the incorrect information remained in the system despite her confirmation. 

These repeated errors have caused my payments to be rejected, my recurring payment to be canceled without my action, and significant concern about whether the loan will be serviced correctly going forward. I made good-faith efforts to pay on time, yet Newrezs internal mistakes repeatedly prevented the payment from being processed. 

At this point, I have lost confidence that Newrez can accurately manage my payment information or properly process my mortgage payments. I am requesting the CFPBs assistance to ensure : My loan is brought current with no late fees, penalties, or negative credit reporting, Newrez corrects and verifies my banking information, and Newrez provides a written explanation of how these repeated data-entry errors occurred and what steps they will take to prevent further issues.

01/20/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","SUMMARY Shellpoint Improperly Reduced Escrow When Removing PMI, Causing {$8900.00} Avoidable Shortage DETAILED COMPLAINT : I am filing a complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( NMLS # XXXX ) for escrow account mismanagement that has caused me significant financial harm totaling {$8900.00}. 

LOAN INFORMATION : Shellpoint Loan Number : XXXX Property Address : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Loan originated : XX/XX/XXXX Loan transferred to XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX WHAT HAPPENED : In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested cancellation of Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) after reaching sufficient equity in my home. Shellpoint approved my request and removed PMI starting with my XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

THE CRITICAL ERROR : When Shellpoint removed my PMI in XX/XX/XXXX, they simultaneously and improperly reduced my monthly escrow collection by the exact amount of the PMI that was removed. 

DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE : According to my monthly mortgage statements from Shellpoint : XX/XX/XXXX Statement : Total monthly payment : {$3600.00} Escrow collection : $ XXXX PMI : Included in payment ( ~ {$270.00} ) XX/XX/XXXX Statement ( after PMI removal ) : Total monthly payment : {$2900.00} Escrow collection : $ XXXX REDUCED BY {$270.00} PMI : {$0.00} REMOVED XX/XX/XXXX Statement : Escrow collection : $ XXXX ( continued at reduced rate ) XX/XX/XXXX Statement : Escrow collection : $ XXXX ( continued at reduced rate ) Current Escrow Balance : {$5600.00} WHY THIS IS IMPROPER ESCROW MANAGEMENT : PMI and escrow are completely separate financial instruments. Removing PMI should have NO impact on escrow collection amounts. 
My homeowners insurance premium was increasing dramatically from approximately {$3500.00} to {$6100.00} for the XXXX policy year. 

Shellpoint should have INCREASED my escrow collection to $ XXXX to properly cover the increased insurance premium and annual property taxes, calculated as : ( {$6100.00} insurance + {$6000.00} taxes ) 12 months = $ XXXX. 
Instead, Shellpoint DECREASED my escrow collection from {$750.00} to {$470.00} - a reduction of exactly {$270.00}, which is precisely the amount of PMI that was removed. 
This created a systematic undercollection of $ XXXX ( {$1000.00} - {$470.00} ) for three months ( XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ), totaling {$1600.00} in undercollected escrow. 

THE RESULTING SHORTAGE : XX/XX/XXXX : When my annual homeowners insurance premium came due ( {$6100.00} ), my escrow account only contained {$5600.00}. Shellpoint paid the insurance premium, creating a negative balance of - {$510.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : My loan was transferred to XXXXXXXX XXXX with this negative escrow balance of - {$510.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : When my property taxes came due ( {$6000.00} ), XXXX paid them from the escrow account. Combined with the negative balance transferred from Shellpoint, plus the federally required XXXX escrow cushion ( {$2000.00} ), this created a total shortage of {$8900.00}. 

FINANCIAL HARM : As a direct result of Shellpoint 's improper escrow management, I am now experiencing the following financial harm : Current Monthly Payment : {$4200.00} Principal & Interest : {$2400.00} Escrow ( correct amount ) : {$1000.00} Shortage repayment : $ XXXX for 12 months Payment Should Have Been : Approximately $ XXXX Principal & Interest : {$2400.00} Escrow ( if properly managed ) : {$1000.00} Additional Financial Burden : $ XXXX 12 months = {$8900.00} This shortage was entirely avoidable. If Shellpoint had : NOT improperly linked PMI removal to escrow reduction Conducted a proper annual escrow analysis as required by RESPA Increased escrow collection to the appropriate amount when insurance increased Maintained escrow at the previous $ XXXX ( or increased it appropriately ) Then this shortage would not exist, and I would not be paying nearly $ XXXX extra for an entire year. 

RESPA VIOLATIONS : Shellpoint 's actions appear to violate the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), specifically : 12 CFR 1024.17 ( b ) - Failure to conduct proper escrow account analysis 12 CFR 1024.17 ( c ) - Failure to collect amounts sufficient to pay anticipated disbursements 12 CFR 1024.17 ( d ) - Creating an avoidable escrow shortage through mismanagement ADDITIONAL CONCERNS : The fact that Shellpoint reduced my escrow by the EXACT amount of the removed PMI ( {$270.00} ) suggests either : A systematic error in their servicing platform that automatically reduces escrow when PMI is removed, or An intentional practice to keep borrowers ' payments artificially low during the transition, creating shortages that result in higher payments later Either scenario represents serious escrow mismanagement and potential RESPA violations.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,32065,None,Consent provided,Web,01/20/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18870241

Despite this, the company withdrew the full payment from one account, causing financial disruption. As a result, my brokerage account fell below required minimums, preventing me from trading for several days and causing financial stress. 

I immediately contacted the company multiple times over six weeks, including letters and phone calls, requesting review of the call recording, acknowledgment of the error, and compensation. The company has failed to confirm that the AVR call recording was reviewed or provide a resolution.

This Writer contends that outright fraud exist, deceptive banking practices are established, when a mortgage servicer herein identified as Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing knowingly with malice aforethought misrepresents the Mortgage Contract Terms that were established by the Mortgage Originator ( Rocket Mortgage ). 

Shellpoint Mortgage Service is the ( mortgage servicer ) and has No Legal Authority to change or alter the terms of this Writer 's mortgage contract by increasing the monthly mortgage payment under the guise of claiming this escrow account is in arrears of - {$3600.00}, when the facts show that this Writer 's property taxes are paid in full for the year with no arrears. 

Claimant contends that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing allegedly violates the Consumer Protection Code 37-1-101 et seq., by purposefully, knowingly, deceptively misrepresenting the mortgage loan terms that includes the monthly amount to be paid in accordance to the mortgage contract is {$870.00} per month. 
The mortgage has a 40 year term, not 43 years inn accordance to Shellpoint. 

For the record, this writer informed Shellpoint Mortgage XXXX that XXXX XXXX will pay for his own Home Owner Insurance Policy and did so on XXXX. 
This writer 's insurance representative provided Proof of Home Owner Insurance, policy number over 30 days ago. On XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage XXXX sent an email message to inform that Shellpoint allegedly used {$2500.00} from this writer 's escrow to acquire Hazard Insurance at this writer 's expense in pretext to justify squandering this writer 's escrow money, while knowing in fact that this writer have already paid for a Home Owner Insurance Policy with Travelers Insurance over 30 days ago for {$2500.00}. 

On XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Service sent an email to inform that they are preparing to pay {$1300.00} on XXXX for property taxes, when in fact this writer is paid in full till XX/XX/XXXX. There are no current property taxes due or owing. 

On XXXX this writer requested that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicer provide a Certified Accounting of Claimant 's mortgage payments to date, balance owed and there should be {$2900.00} in escrow pending the reimbursement of Claimant 's misused money that Shellpoint recklessly spent for an unwarranted Hazard Insurance that Shellpoint was not authorized to spend in this reckless manner. 

Given the following this writer contends that unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) have occurred. 
Claimant contends under what legal authority, law or procedure does Shellpoint Mortgage Services have the right to manipulate XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX escrow money for an unwarranted Hazard Insurance that was not needed, nor have this writer been provided with any Proof Of Insurance, as this writer did on XXXX. 
Wrong is wrong and wrong establishes gross negligence and liability. 

Request was made on XXXX for Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, to provide a Certified Accounting of what mortgage amount have been paid to date, what is the current mortgage balance paid to date, and evidence of the amount of {$2900.00} USD needs to be factually documented in this Writer 's escrow account. 

Given the level of alleged outright mortgage fraud observed in this writer 's case this writer will pay his own property taxes when it becomes due and have already provided evidence of having purchased Home Owner Property Insurance for the year with Travelers Home Insurance to Shellpoint Mortgage. The relevant facts also demonstrate the following. 

The relevant record will establish that Shellpoint Mortgage falsely represented to XXXX Credit Bureau, XXXX XXXX XXXX that this writer failed to pay his mortgage this past XX/XX/XXXX, and claimed that no payment was received in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, when in fact that was a clear false representation, an outright lie meant to cause malicious damage to this writer 's credit and to cause financial harm, when in fact all payments to date have been made. 
Shellpoint shows negligence when it chooses not to accept this writer 's payments, thus this writer was caused to send certified mail payments. 

The relevant historical facts will establish that this Writer 's monthly mortgage in accordance to the mortgage contract is {$870.00} not {$1400.00} that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing demanded this writer pay, when Shellpoint reported that this writer 's escrow was deficient. This writer satisfied the alleged deficiency by obtaining a Tax Credit from the Maryland Assessment & Taxation Dept. this past XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3.00}, XXXX that was retroactively applied to Claimant 's escrow account on XXXX. According to Shellpoint Mortgage a total of {$2700.00} was paid from this writer 's escrow account. 

The adjusted total from the Tax Credit amounting to {$3500.00} plus {$2700.00} paid from this writer 's escrow account totals {$6200.00}. 
The property taxes for XX/XX/XXXX totaled {$5700.00}. 

The relevant record will show that this writer paid the requested amount of {$1400.00} from XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. The sub total of the four ( 4 ) payments amounted to {$5700.00}. In accordance to Shellpoint {$680.00} x 4 = {$2700.00} was deducted to pay the principal. The amount of {$730.00} x 4 = {$2900.00} was deducted for the interest. Under what legal authority does Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing have the right to alter the terms of Claimant 's mortgage contract as the servicer for the mortgage? 

This Writer should have received a credit of {$2700.00} after the property taxes were paid. There should be absolutely No Negative balance of {$3600.00} as Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing falsely represents. The adjusted sub total from the four ( 4 ) payments at {$1400.00} should have allowed for an escrow credit of {$2700.00}. This writer have written to the Maryland Assessment & Taxation Dept. 
to confirm that Claimant ( XXXX XXXX XXXX has no property tax arrears in the amount of {$3600.00} that Shellpoint Mortgage falsely represents with no evidence, other than faulty accounting practices. 
Claimant 's mortgage balance should be less then {$180000.00} USD not {$180.00}, XXXX USD. A certified accounting is requested to insure Shellpoint Mortgage is not misappropriating any of Claimant 's hard earned income and payments made. 

Legal action will be sought if Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, XXXX XXXX as alleged President of Shellpoint continues to fraudulently misrepresent, slander Claimant 's name and falsely accuse claimant of being in arrears or negligently claiming that payments are 30 days late, which is proven ly false. 

"" Where there is evidence of bad faith, slander, misrepresentation of the facts on the part of the mortgage servicer ( Shellpoint MortgageServicer ), the representations by Shellpoint lose all trustworthiness.

11/08/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Servicing Manipulation Through Dual-System Reporting Finding : Analysis of borrower portal data from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, reveals that NewRez LLC and its subservicer Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, both controlled by XXXX XXXX XXXX , maintained conflicting digital records for the same VA-guaranteed loan XXXX No. XXXX ). 

The NewRez portal reflected the account as current, while the Shellpoint portal simultaneously reflected delinquency, late fees, and a negative escrow balance. Both systems displayed the identical principal balance ( {$580000.00} ) and property information, confirming that they draw from the same master data repository. This shows deliberate dual-system manipulation, not an isolated clerical error. 



Evidence : 1. Recorded call logs and transcripts ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) confirm Shellpoint representatives repeatedly acknowledged holding {$12000.00}, later corrected to nearly {$100000.00}, in unapplied fundspayments received but not credited to the loan. 
2. Shellpoint Cure Default letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ) demanded {$6800.00} by XX/XX/XXXX while records proved the borrower was fully paid through that date. 
3. Portal captures from both NewRez and Shellpoint show contradictory account statuses within the same billing cycle. 
4. CFPB complaint chain ( XXXX. XXXX through XXXX ) documents consistent ledger falsification, delayed posting, and repeated non-responses to statutory Notices of Error. 
5. XX/XX/XXXX call recording specifically references an account balance discrepancy of {$3900.00} versus {$4000.00} and confirms the servicers own admission that an escalation complaint was filed due to incorrect figures. 



Interpretation : This dual-reporting practice constitutes a systemic servicing manipulation scheme, wherein XXXX-controlled entities distort loan performance data for profit. 
Externally, the portfolio appears performing, sustaining XXXX reported servicing income and securitization valuations. 
Internally, borrowers are shown as delinquent, generating illegal late-fee revenue and foreclosure leverage. 

These acts violate multiple federal provisions : 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) failure to credit payments as of the date received ; 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) misapplication of payments ; 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts ( UDAAP ) ; 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) false representation of debt ; and 18 U.S.C. 1344 ( 1 ) bank fraud via manipulation of custodial funds and investor reporting. 

Supporting precedents include : XXXX v. XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX La. XXXX ) ; and CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( consent order ). 
Each confirms servicer liability for misapplication and dual-ledger deception under RESPA and TILA.

Risk Impact and Damages : The harm from this manipulation is quantifiable and severe : 1. Financial Damages {$100000.00} Unapplied Funds : These are payments made in good faith, sequestered by the servicer in suspense accounts in violation of 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ). The funds should have been immediately credited to principal, reducing long-term interest accrual and amortization costs. 
2. Derivative and Consequential Damages {>= $1,000,000} : This figure is substantiated by measurable and foreseeable consequences of the servicers unlawful conduct, including : Credit impairment and reputational injury : False delinquency reporting to credit bureaus, lowering XXXX scores and obstructing refinancing or VA program eligibility. 
Emotional and psychological harm : Threatening letters and cure default notices received despite confirmed payments, constituting harassment under the FDCPA and CFPB consent orders. 
Legal exposure and litigation costs : Continuous need to file CFPB, XXXX XXXXXXXX, and AG complaints, compile forensic evidence, and retain counsel due to Shellpoints systemic non-response. 
Time-value losses : Deprivation of use of approximately {$100000.00} in funds since first misapplication. 
Market impact : Damage to borrowers standing with federal guarantors ( VA/HUD ) and impairment of property equity, causing long-term asset depreciation. 
These harms fall squarely within compensatory and punitive categories recognized under : 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) ( actual damages + additional statutory up to {$2000.00} per violation ), 15 U.S.C. 1692k ( a ) ( actual and punitive damages for FDCPA violations ), and Common-law tort precedents for bad-faith servicing ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ). 

Accordingly, total damages are now quantified as : {$100000.00} ( principal misapplied ) + {>= $1,000,000} ( consequential, statutory, reputational, and punitive ) = {>= $1,000,000} aggregate claim.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/08/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17113570

the two payments were incorrectly applied to my mortgage.

the fault is on their end for incorrectly applying my mortgage payment, and I should not be inconvienenced by having to call back to request the late fee be removed because of their fault and limitations of their accounting system. 

the customer service person was also rude, talking over me and arguing with me.

10/22/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Applying for or obtaining a modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or deed-in-lieu","In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the lender Newrez to explain that my payment dates have changed with my employer because my employment changed. This was going to cause my pay days to not line up with the payment dates of the mortgage loan. I would have to at that time pull my loan out of their automatic payment plan. 
I asked if there was any way to change the loan payment due date. They said no only if I refinanced the loan. Due to interest rates that wouldn't have been a wise decision. 
I explained my main concern is that my monthly payment would become late. Then I would get a late fee of {$120.00} added to my due dates which would prevent me from being able to make my full payment. 
I stopped the automatic payment plan set up with Newerz and set up auto pay with my personal bank XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, my credit union mailed the loan payment checks to Newrez and by the time my checks cleared for Newrez I started to receive late payment fees of {$120.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called Newrez in XXXX and asked if they could waive the 1st late payment fee. I explained that with the elate payment fee on my account it is preventing me from setting up automatic payments with Newrez. Their system will not let you make modifications to the auto pay or set up auto pay if there is a late fee on the account or past due money owed. 
They told me to just pay the late fee and then I would be able to set up the auto pay. 
I explained it was my first late payment and that their policy states they can waive the first late payment fee. The representative I talked to in XXXX told me they would waive it after I made my full payment of what was due for the month. I explained to her that If they didnt waive it now then I wouldn't be able to set up auto payments on their website to come out semimonthly ( once every 2 weeks ) and by the time may bank sends them the payment for the month it will be late by on day past their grace period and then there will be an additional late payment fee added to my account and that would once again prevent me from setting up auto pay and also it would prevent me from having enough money the next month to pay the full loan payment with the additional late payment fee.

I told them Im trying to do the right thing ; Im wanting to pay what is owed. I want to set up auto pay semimonthly so my payments will not be late. 
I was told by the Newrez rep to call back after the XXXX payment went through, and they would waive the late payment fee. 
I called back in XXXX after the payment cleared. It did clear late and there was another late payment fee added to my account. This time the rep told me they can only waive the first late payment fee and not the second one. I tried to explain that I was previously told they couldnt waive the first late payment fee until my loan payment was current and the only reason the 2nd late payment fee was added to the account was because I couldnt set up the auto pay on their website until there was no late payment fee so my bank mailed the payment check and by the time it clears it was late. I told them I was told by their rep all I had to do was call back after the payment clear and they would help me. 
Well, they didn't help me. I was charged a late payment fee in XXXX and XXXX. 
I called back in XXXX and explained the above to a new rep from Newrez. She said they dont do waivers of late payment fees. I told her that is not what I was told in XXXX or XXXX when I called. She said there was nothing she could do. I asked to talk to a supervisor. I was transferred to a supervisor. I explained all the above and told her Im trying to set up auto pay but cant on their website when there is a late payment fee. I explained that I paid the late payment fee with my XXXX payment but since I wasn't able to set up auto pay in their system the pay in XXXX was late by one day and now there is another late payment fee and ow I cant set up auto pay again and Im getting trapped in this endless cycle and I just need them to please waive the late payment fee of {$120.00} so I can set up auto pay in their system. She told me she would send up the notes of my problem to a manager and see about getting the late payment fee waived.

The call ended and a few hours later I called back to check the status, and I was told by the first rep I talked to that they dont waive the 2nd late payment fee. I painfully explained my story to that rep again, she said there was nothing she could do, and she transferred me to a supervisor. That supervisor told me she sees the notes in the account, and it looks like I now need to send in a written request for them to waive the late payment fee but would need to make the account current before they would set up auto pay. I explained that was never told to me before that I had to write a written note requesting why I need them to waive the late fee. I explained Ive been calling about this issue for the past 3 months, and Im told something different every time. She told me if I paid the late payment fee it would fix the issue. I explained that I had been told that 3 times before and it never fixes the issue because I cant afford the late payment fee, I cant pay the loan from my bank on time because of how long it take the check to process that they send and I cant set up the auto pay with their bank ( Newrez ) until there is no late fee on the account. She basically said there was nothing she could do and she was sorry. She did ask me to send in a payment at that time, and I explained I couldnt afford it. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I paid the last late payment fee of {$120.00}. I then went on Newrez website to set up the auto pay for semimonthly. At this point in time, I had to pay 3 late payment fees over the course of 3 months and each month I was told by Newerz reps the fee would be waived when I made the account current and each time, they never did that. THEY LIED TO ME EVERY TIME. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I filled out and application on the Newrez website for loan assistance. I had to change home insurance companys this year because my previous company was going to drop my coverage because they no longer provide Dog Bite coverage. I had to find a new home insurance company that offers dog coverage. When this switch happen it caused Newrez to make payment to the new insurance company which put my escrow in the negative. Currently Im {$2600.00} behind on my escrow balance and with my current income compared to what I owe monthly to other debts I can no longer afford my current mortgage payment, and I can not pay into the escrow to make the account current. If they revise my current mortgage and escrow and adjust the monthly payment to increase to pay the balance owed in my escrow it will definitively make my monthly payment even more expensive which will force me to stop making the monthly payments. I have about {$9000.00} in debts I need to pay off so I can afford my mortgage again. I will be able to pay off those debts in 3 months if Newrez is willing to pause my mortgage payments for the next 3 months. I will be able to pay the escrow balance in that time also. If Newrez was to let my not pay my mortgage payments for 4 months I would be able to pay off the {$9000.00} in debts and the escrow balance. If they review my escrow balance in XX/XX/XXXX, which is when they say they will, they will determine the need to increase my escrow monthly payment which will increase my mortgage payment which will effectively put me in a position where I will not be able to pay or afford my mortgage. 
I have not heard back from them on my application for loan modification or payment pauses. I also have no faith in them helping me as they lied to me over and over again about helping me with the late payment fees. Which they never did help me with. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into the Newrez website set up the semimonthly auto pay and Im hoping all will be ok now.

I just need some type of health. If they are willing to pause my payments for 4-5 months it would let me pay off the other debts, I have that will free up the month I need monthly to make the full mortgage payment and pay off the escrow before they increase my monthly escrow payments.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,342XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,10/22/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16758771
09/24/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"What happened : I am the homeowner of the property for which Shellpoint holds the mortgage. After storm damage from XXXX XXXX, my insurer ( XXXX XXXX ) issued claim proceeds. The first check ( endorsed by Shellpoint ) went stale before I could deposit it due in part to lack of response and delay by Shellpoint to my many written queries for assistance ( copies can be provided ). This check was voided. XXXX then reissued the same fundshalf via XXXX and half by replacement check naming Shellpoint as mortgagee. The replacement funds were disbursed in this fashion due to the delays and the home falling into further disrepair as a result. 

I sent Shellpoint email on XX/XX/year> explaining to them what happened with the first check and explaining to them my concern that the replacement check would be misapplied as 'additional ' funds and would then cause them to re-categorize my claim as a 'monitored ' claim and the would hold the funds in escrow and the money would not be released to me. When they did not acknowledge or reply to my email sent to the address they explicitly instruct clients to send loss-draft concerns to, I wrote again on XX/XX/year> and to date, have not received any response whatsoever. 

I then called the Loss-draft department and as always, was directed to a noisy call center and someone who spoke broken XXXX, someone with whom I had a goodly deal of difficulty communicating. I did my best to communicate with this person, albeit I kept getting put on hold, tried to explain, was told "" Yes, yes, will not hold your money, will return check ''. I was uncomfortable with the conversation so I called back, hoping to speak with someone else that could at least speak XXXX. I was able to communicate better, I thought, with the second person who seemed to at least understand what I was saying and said that I "" was not to worry, I will document this in your file, Ma'am ''. 

I then created PDF documents I uploaded into Shellpoints insurance portal ( which they acknowledged receipt of ), and in spite of copies of the same being included with the replacement check, Shellpoint still misapplied the funds into escrow. 
Shellpoint has carelessly and negligently misapplied this replacement check as additional funds and diverted it into escrow, instead of endorsing and releasing it to me. This is incorrect : the check represents the same proceeds already approved and already endorsed, not supplemental or new funds. 

In spite of being explicitly told this in documents I uploaded into Shellpoints insurance portal ( which they acknowledged receipt of ), and in spite of a clear letter of explanation being included with the replacement check, Shellpoint still misapplied the funds into escrow. In spite of XXXX phone calls and XXXX EMAIL, they STILL kept the funds that they literally already signed off on less than a month ago. 

I even sent the original voided check back at my own expense by XXXX, further proving these were replacementnot newfunds. Shellpoint ignored this documentation and still withheld the money and discarded the prepaid overnight label that I provided for them at considerable expense to myself. I certainly would not have paid to overnight a check to them for them to keep it, nor would I have paid for an overnight label for them to discard. 

This error has delayed necessary storm repairs and exposed the home to additional damage. My XXXX have done work for which they can not be paid. They are angry, the home is still in disrepair and the good working relationship I have with them is suffering as a result of this negligence. 

On XX/XX/year> I called Shellpoint again regarding the replacement claim check. Initially, my call was routed through the usual call-center process. The call-center representative spoke XXXX clearly and told me that my claim had been classified as a monitored claim because it was over {$40000.00}. I immediately pointed out that the replacement check was for approximately {$15000.00}, and that half of the original funds had already been wired directly to me by XXXX. The representative responded in a patronizing tone, explaining, No maam, it was {$30000.00} plus {$15000.00}, and that is over {$40000.00}, effectively treating the replacement check as additional money rather than the reissue of the same funds already approved and endorsed. 

When I mentioned that I was preparing to file a CFPB complaint, my call was escalated to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX. XXXX placed me on hold to review the file, then returned with the same incorrect position, treating the replacement check as if it were additional funds. I pushed back and reminded her that I had already provided extensive documentation proving this was not new funding, including : XXXX. Multiple emails from XXXX confirming the reissue process, XXXX. Uploads through Shellpoints own insurance portal with photos of the original endorsed check clearly marked VOID, XXXX. A letter of explanation included with the replacement payment, and XXXX. The actual original endorsed check itself, enclosed so they could confirm it had never been cashed. 
XXXX eventually acknowledged that she could see the paperwork in their system and that the replacement check should not have been escrowed. I also raised the issue that I had paid for and provided my own FedEx overnight label to expedite the process, but Shellpoint discarded it, insisting we dont do FedEx. As a result, their mishandling has caused even further delay while the funds are routed through their slower XXXX system. 

The bottom line is that Shellpoint admitted the funds were misapplied, but their error has already resulted in weeks of unnecessary delay. Their continued insistence on treating a replacement check as additional funds directly contradicts the documentation they had in hand. 

At this time, Shellpoint has emailed me a tracking number. However, their insurance portal continues to reflect that my funds are in my restricted escrow account, an inconsistency that underscores the continued gross mishandling of my claim and represents a dereliction of their fiduciary duty to my claim.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",WY,827XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/24/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16148274
01/08/26,Debt collection,I do not know,False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I am submitting this formal complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( dba NewRez LLC ) for repeated inaccurate, misleading, and deceptive servicing practices regarding my mortgage loan. 
This includes falsely acknowledging and responding to inquiries/disputes I never submitted, mischaracterizing prior communications sent to other servicers ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and NewRez LLC ) as directed to them, and providing contradictory/inaccurate information about loan ownership and status. 
This also includes sending a deficient inquiry response masquerading as a "" Validation of Debt '' letter, which fails to meet FDCPA requirements for proper debt validation and instead frames it as a reply to a non-existent QWR/dispute under RESPA/Regulation X XXXX 
Below, I outline all the key issues in detail, including the concrete limitations of Shellpoint 's XX/XX/XXXX letter as a claimed "" Validation of Debt '' notice, broken down point-by-point using the exact requirements of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) validation notice under 15 U.S.C. 1692g and Regulation F ( 12 CFR 1006.34 ). These issues demonstrate systemic inaccuracies that have created material errors in my loan records, potentially impacting servicing, credit reporting, payments, or future obligations. 
Detailed Outline of Key Issues : XXXX. No Correspondence Sent to Shellpoint by Me I never sent any inquiries, Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ), Notices of Error, written disputes, or other correspondence to Shellpoint. All prior requests went to XXXX XXXX XXXX and NewRez LLC only. Despite this, Shellpoint has falsely characterized and responded to non-existent submissions as if they were formal disputes directed to them under RESPA/Regulation X. This mischaracterization is a foundational inaccuracy in their communications. 
XXXX. False Acknowledgment in the XX/XX/XXXX Letter Shellpoint 's XX/XX/XXXX letter falsely states : "" this letter is to acknowledge your recent inquiry regarding the above referenced loan. '' It also claims that, if seeking creditor information, the owner is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. No assignment to XXXX XXXX Loan XXXX XXXX is recorded in public county records. This letter invents a "" recent inquiry '' from me that never occurred, creating a false record of borrower-servicer interaction. 
XXXX. Inaccuracies and Deficiencies in the XX/XX/XXXX "" Validation of Debt '' Letter ( Reference No. XXXX ) This letter, titled "" Validation of Debt '' but not functioning as such, falsely states it is "" in response to your inquiry '' ( none sent ) and claims Shellpoint is/was the servicer for XXXX XXXX Loan Acquisition LP ( "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ). It lists the loan owner as "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, with details including principal balance {$0.00} ( exclusive of accrued interest, fees, or charges ), origination XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX, original principal {$580000.00}, maturity XX/XX/XXXX, and notes the loan transferred from Shellpoint servicing to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Enclosures included Note, Deed of Trust, "" Goodby Letter, '' and Loan History. 
o The "" FNMA XXXX XXXX '' reference is inaccurate/misleading : Fannie Mae sold non-performing loan pools ( FNMA XXXX XXXX ) in bulk to private investors ( e.g., RCF II-associated entities ), removing them from Fannie Mae ownership. "" FNMA XXXX XXXX '' is a historical sale identifier, not a current owner. Ownership claims conflict with no recorded assignment to RCF II and public practices for such pools. 
o Shellpoint treated non-existent submissions as formal disputes under XXXX XXXX, claimed to investigate them as QWRs, asserted they lacked sufficient detail, and denied servicing errorsdespite no submission from me. 
o As a purported debt validation, the letter is deficient and masquerading as compliant. 
Concrete Limitations of the XX/XX/XXXX Shellpoint Letter as a Claimed "" Validation of Debt '' Notice XXXX. Missing the mandatory "" debt collector '' disclosure Required : The letter must clearly state that it is from a debt collector ( or use language substantially similar to : "" This communication is from a debt collector '' ). 
In this letter : Completely absent. Nowhere does it say Shellpoint is acting as a debt collector or that the communication is from XXXX. 
Result : Fatal defect. This alone disqualifies it as a valid FDCPA validation notice. 
XXXX. No statement of XXXX dispute rights Required : Must include clear language such as : '' Unless you notify this office within XXXX  days after receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector. '' "" If you notify this office in writing within XXXX  days from receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt, or any portion thereof, this office will obtain verification of the debt or obtain a copy of a judgment against you and a copy of such verification or judgment will be mailed to you by the debt collector. '' "" Upon your written request within the XXXX period, this office will provide you with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor. '' In this letter : XXXX mention of any XXXX dispute window, verification process, or original creditor request. Instead, it tells me the alleged "" dispute '' ( which I never sent ) lacks detail and that they found no servicing error. 
Result : No dispute rights are communicated not a validation notice. 
XXXX. No "" validation period end date '' or clear XXXX clock Required : The letter must specify when the XXXX period ends ( or at minimum make the timeline obvious ). 
In this letter : No date is given for when any dispute period starts or ends. 
Result : No clock is set fails. 
XXXX. Incomplete / non-compliant debt amount and itemization Required : The current amount of the debt as of a specific date, plus either : A full itemization ( principal, interest, fees, etc. ), or A reference to a recent periodic statement under Reg Z 1026.41 ( for mortgages ). 
In this letter : Only gives "" {$0.00} ( exclusive of accrued interest, fees, or other charges ) ''. No total amount due is stated. No itemization of the excluded items ( e.g., accrued interest at 7.00 %, fees, or other charges ). No reference to a recent periodic statement under Regulation Z. The exclusions make the figure meaningless for debt validation purposes. 
Result : Does not provide the actual debt amount I would need to dispute or pay. 
XXXX. Wrong framing and timing Required : A validation notice must be sent within XXXX  days of the debt collectors initial communication with the consumer regarding the collection of the debt ( or be the initial communication itself ). 
In this letter : Explicitly frames itself as a response to "" your inquiry '' and "" your dispute '' meaning it assumes prior contact and treats this as a follow-up. A true validation notice is proactive, not reactive. 
Result : Can not be an initial validation notice because it presupposes prior communication. 
XXXX. XXXX language dominates not FDCPA What it does instead : Spends most of the letter explaining why certain questions are outside the scope of a Qualified Written Request under RESPA/Regulation X , directing me to public records ( SEC , county recorder ), refusing to provide internal documents, and concluding no servicing error occurred. 
Result : This is clearly written as a RESPA response letter ( or partial denial ), not an FDCPA validation notice. The XXXX laws have different triggers, obligations, and content requirements. 
Bottom-line concrete summary : This letter is not and can not reasonably be considered a valid FDCPA debt validation notice because it fails every single core mandatory element : No debt collector disclosure ; No XXXX dispute/verification language ; No end date for the validation period ; No complete debt amount or proper itemization ; Wrong timing and framing ( response, not initial notice ) ; Focused on RESPA limits instead of FDCPA rights XXXX It is a defective RESPA/QWR response that Shellpoint has dressed up with the label "" Validation of Debt '' but it does not satisfy the legal requirements to trigger the FDCPA 's validation protections or obligations. Shellpoint failed to properly validate the debt under FDCPA. It is not a compliant validation, so any collection activity after an actual FDCPA dispute could remain improper until they send a proper notice and verify. 
XXXX. Shellpoint 's Well-Documented Pattern of Similar Issues and Complaints Shellpoint has a history of engaging in the types of practices described above, as evidenced by high volumes of consumer complaints and regulatory actions : o High volumes of CFPB complaints : Frequently tops or ranks high in mortgage/home-equity complaints ( e.g., XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XXXX XXXX for home-equity alone ; earlier peaks like XXXX in certain quarters post-acquisitions/transfers ). Common themes include trouble during payment process, inaccurate information, struggling to pay mortgage, servicing transfer errors, misapplied payments, deceptive communications, and inadequate responses. 
o Enforcement actions : CFPB fined Shellpoint {$2.00} XXXX in XXXX for misrepresenting loan modification program terms to borrowers. 
o Class action settlements : {$500000.00} in XXXX for misleading mortgage statements sent to CARES Act forbearance participants ( violating FDCPA/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Other suits involve illegal inspection fees ( e.g., XXXX findings of over {$270000.00} unlawfully charged ), unauthorized forbearance placements, inaccurate credit reporting, force-placed insurance errors, and deceptive default notices. 
o Ongoing litigation/complaints : Multiple class actions and consumer reports allege deceptive practices, unauthorized fees, inaccurate debt validation/ownership claims, poor record-keeping during transfers, and failure to correct errors ( e.g., high XXXXConsumer ratings averaging XXXX stars, with hundreds of reviews citing fraud, unethical behavior, and predatory servicing ). 
I have sent Shellpoint a corrective letter disputing these inaccuracies and putting them on notice of this CFPB complaint.

Shellpoint is a debt collector and uses debt collection practices to harass consumers, even for mortages in good standing. 

In XXXX while the the loan servicing transition was still ongoing, a phone agent advised me to pay by check until the XXXX could be set up. Instead, they cashed my checked AND withdrew the same amount from my checking account, setting off a comedy of contradictory communications ever since.

09/09/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","To the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, am pleading for your urgent assistance. My mortgage servicers mishandling of my account has placed me, my son and my fianc in a living nightmare. I have sent multiple emails and made repeated calls, yet they still attempted foreclosure on my home. They failed to pay my escrow in a timely manner, which caused my homeowners insurance to be cancelled during an active disaster claim. Now they are attempting to force me into overpriced force-placed insurance. 
Because of their negligence, I was forced to pay {$10000.00} just to stop foreclosure. The escrow payment due in XXXX was not made until the end of XXXX. As a result, my property remains uninsured, uninhabitable, and unsafe. Their actions are not only unethical but are also financially and emotionally destroying my family. 
Here is what has happened : Escrow Mismanagement : They failed to pay my insurance escrow on time, resulting in cancellation of coverage. 
Foreclosure Attempts : Despite my communications, they moved to foreclose, forcing me to pay thousands of dollars I could not afford. 
XXXX XXXX : They are now attempting to impose force-placed insurance after their own failure caused my policy to lapse. 
Broken Forbearance Agreement : I was granted a six-month forbearance but later told it was only XXXX months, despite assurances it could be extended. 
Misrepresentation : I was repeatedly misled by representatives about available relief and timelines. 
Because of these failures, I am trapped in a severely damaged home. Storms left holes in my roof, exposed wiring, no central air, and ongoing fire hazards. My family has nearly lost the house to fire XXXX times due to electrical issues caused by the disasters. Yet instead of helping, my servicer has made our situation worse at every step. 
I have documentation to support everything I am statingemails, XXXX determinations, XXXX reports, photos, denial letters, and communications with the servicer. I have always paid my bills and have over XXXX years of equity in this home. I am not refusing to pay ; I simply need protection from my servicers mishandling, time to stabilize, and a fair opportunity to recover. 
The CFPB exists to protect consumers from exactly this type of abusive and negligent behavior. I am asking you to hold my servicer accountable for : XXXX. Failing to pay escrow on time, causing loss of coverage. 
XXXX. Attempting foreclosure while I was in active communication. 
XXXX. Misrepresenting forbearance terms. 
XXXX. Forcing unnecessary and costly insurance. 
Please intervene so that I can preserve my home and protect my son. This house has been mine for over XXXX years. I built it, Ive maintained it, and I have always been a responsible borrower. Now, because of their failures, I am being pushed toward financial ruin and homelessness. 
I respectfully request immediate review and assistance. 



P.S. Every time I call, they tell me they can not help because they are an inbound call center. They do not care at all and all calls are recorded. They gave me a single point when I was getting lied to and foreclosed on. In fact anytime I called it would go straight that single point of contact automatically. automatically. Funny how they only care when they are robbing you of your money illegally. 

This was provided to me by state farm. Also I can not get new insurance due to Shellpoint 's negligence as I am still in the middle of a natural disaster claim with over XXXX damage to my home.

11/14/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this complaint because Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing has mishandled my HELOC account and loan modification in several serious ways, including false accounting, dual tracking, rejection of payments, incorrect reporting of delinquency, and potential violations of the terms of my HELOC agreement. Their actions have caused significant financial harm, unnecessary delinquency, and extreme emotional distress. 

XXXX. Draw Period Violation HELOC Terms Not Followed My HELOC originated in XXXX with an initial XXXX draw period and a maximum XXXX draw period, meaning the draw period should have ended no later than XXXX. 

Shellpoint is now claiming the draw period ended XX/XX/XXXX, which contradicts the actual contract terms and appears to artificially extend interest-only status to inflate the balance. 

This is a major concern under : TILA ( material loan term changes ) RESPA ( misrepresenting loan terms ) Contract law 2. Mishandled Loan Modification ( XX/XX/XXXX ) In XXXX, I entered into a modification with a confirmed post-modification principal balance of : {$110000.00} This included all arrears, fees, and outstanding charges. 

I paid : {$16000.00} toward the down payment ( more than required ) {$10000.00} in monthly payments until Shellpoint stopped accepting payments {$7600.00} paid through my bankruptcy trustee {$4600.00} in payments from XX/XX/XXXX to present, and they have now stopped accepting payments again. 

Despite these payments, Shellpoint refuses to apply the modification correctly and continues to misrepresent my principal balance. 

XXXX. Incorrect Principal Balance & False Accounting Shellpoints records contain major inconsistencies : Loan history shows principal : {$110000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) Proposed modification lists principal : {$120000.00} Capitalized amount : {$10000.00} Claimed arrears : {$15000.00} These figures can not all be correct. 
They suggest : Improper capitalization of disputed fees Fabricated arrears Failure to honor the XXXX modification This may violate RESPA servicing requirements, Regulation X, and fair servicing obligations. 

4. Dual Tracking Violation Federal & State On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint sent me a letter stating : Your application is complete you have protection from foreclosure while we evaluate. 

This letter triggers : 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ) ( federal dual-tracking rules ) California HBOR 2923.6 & 2924.18 Despite this : Shellpoint rejected three payments AFTER the complete-application letter.

They then resumed foreclosure actions. This is a direct dual-tracking violation.

5. Rejected Payments & Returned Funds After acknowledging my application as complete, Shellpoint : Rejected XXXX electronic payments Returned another by check Prevented multiple weekly payments from posting Shellpoint is now claiming I am delinquent over {$15000.00}, even though : The delinquency is a direct result of Shellpoint refusing to apply the payments.

Instead of receiving a notice that we were short funds, they sent the entire pmt to our principal balance with no notification or courtesy call asking if we even received the letter! Since we didnt know, we continued making our new payments but were accruing late fees and didnt understand why. We finally were forced to pay over {$150.00}. in fees to get our mortgage back in good standing. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I am now doing the bills, I pay our mortgages 2 weeks early. When I mailed our XXXX payment in, a letter stating our escrow went up again came which means they crossed in the mail. They did the same thing. Applied our monthly payment to principal, charging us a late fee and almost adding a 30 day late to our credit report! I called customer service and was told this is how they do business. I asked to speak to a supervisor, they sent me to another service rep. I demanded to speak with someone else and finally spoke to a supervisor who explained they are not waiving any fee since they waived one in XXXX. I refused to pay the fee but I did pay the amount we were short order to bring my payment status current. At that time little did I know they charged me ANOTHER LATE FEE because the amount I was short and the late fee I refused to pay made me late a second time. How is this ok?! So today I had to pay another late fee to bring my payment current. 
Mind you, we have another mortgage with them and this has NEVER happens. We are on top of our bills. This is fraud and I want these late fees back! I pay on time and will not be treated this way.

I write today to urge you to stand firmly in defense of the Foreclosure Abuse Prevention Act ( FAPA ) and, most importantly, its retroactive application.

For too long, large financial institutions and their foreclosure law firms have abused homeowners through endless litigation gamesserial filings, voluntary discontinuances, and repeated acceleration and de-acceleration of the same loan. Families like mine have lived for more than a decade under the crushing weight of lawsuits that should have been barred years ago. Without retroactivity, the very abuses FAPA was designed to stop will continue to punish those of us who have already suffered most. 
In my own case, I have endured repeated filings by banks and servicers, nine separate settlement conferences, and years of uncertainty that robbed my children and me of peace of mind. I have faced intimidation, wrongful credit reporting, and contradictory claims about who even owns my loan. These are not technicalities. They are human costslost time with family, financial devastation, and the constant fear of losing ones home. 
Retroactive application of FAPA is essential because the misconduct happened in the past. To deny retroactivity would reward banks and servicers who already manipulated the system, while leaving families unprotected. That would turn justice on its head. 
Banks argue that retroactivity strips them of vested rights. But the real vested rights are those of New York families to live free of stale and abusive lawsuits. The Legislature passed FAPA precisely because of this abuse. If retroactivity is stripped away, the law becomes a hollow promise, fixing the future while abandoning the families whose suffering demanded reform in the first place. 
I respectfully ask you to continue to defend FAPA in the courts and in the public arena, and to make clear that its protections apply retroactively. Thousands of New York families are counting on this law to finally put an end to abusive foreclosure practices. 
Thank you for your commitment to fairness, justice, and the protection of New Yorkers.

Since my Chapter XXXX discharge on XX/XX/XXXX, NewRez has engaged in conduct that clearly violates : 11 U.S.C. 524 ( i ) ( post-discharge misapplication causing injury ) RESPA / XXXX XXXX ( XXXX C.F.R. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) FCRA ( XXXX5 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ), XXXX ( b ) ) FDCPA ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX ) VA mortgage-servicing regulations ( XXXX C.F.R. XXXX ) NewRez is actively creating false delinquency, charging wrongful late fees, issuing contradictory payment demands, misapplying payments, and furnishing false credit reporting that contradicts both my bankruptcy and their own internal records. 

This is an immediate risk of wrongful foreclosure on a veterans home based on corrupted data. 

I am asking CFPB to treat this as a priority, high-risk case. 



XXXX. My Mortgage Was NOT XXXX NewRez Is Misrepresenting It My Chapter XXXX bankruptcy ( Case XXXX ) did not discharge or surrender my VA mortgage. 
Schedule D lists NewRez as a secured creditor with approx. {$600000.00} owed. 
I retained the property. 
The mortgage survived bankruptcy. 
I continued to make payments before and after discharge. 

Despite this, NewRez has been reporting to Experian that the mortgage is : XXXX through Chapter XXXX Paid off Closed Never late This is false, misleading, and illegal. 



XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XXXX Calls : Servicing Collapse After Discharge A. XX/XX/XXXX First Recorded Failure ( Post-Discharge ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to make my XXXX payment. XXXX systems contradicted themselves : Online portal : {$3900.00} due XXXX internal system : {$4000.00} due Representative admitted the system was wrong and said : I need to file a complaint on your behalf and escalate this to upper-level review. 

This is a direct post-discharge misapplication under XXXX ( i ) : NewRez could not produce a correct payment amount for the same month. 



XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Second Recorded Failure ( Post-Discharge ) The next day, another NewRez representative quoted : Total amount due : {$5000.00} Late charges : {$1000.00} Previous amounts contradicted ( both {$3900.00} and {$4000.00} ) Then NewRez accepted a {$2000.00} partial payment, acknowledging the account was unstable. 

They then attempted to sell me a mortgage purchase program, even while claiming delinquency something that can not occur if the system is accurate. 



IV. This Creates a Post-Discharge Violation Under 524 ( i ) Under 11 U.S.C. 524 ( i ), a servicer violates the discharge order if : the creditor willfully fails to credit payments received thereby causing material injury. 

The XXXX calls show : Contradictory payment amounts Wrong delinquency Improper late fees Systemic misapplication Internal escalation due to corrupted data Ongoing harm to me as a XXXX debtor Cases like XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC, In re XXXX, In re XXXX, and In re XXXX show that this conduct is a direct bankruptcy violation. 



V. FCRA Violations Are Clear and Willful Experian tradeline shows : XXXX in Chapter XXXX Paid off Closed No payments due Never late This contradicts : XXXX demands for payments XXXX foreclosure posture XXXX XXXX contradictions My bankruptcy schedules This violates : 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( furnishing known inaccuracies ) 1681s-2 ( b ) ( failure to correct after notice ) Precedents : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX 



VI. RESPA / Reg X Violations NewRez failed to maintain accurate records as required by : 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( Failure to correctly apply payments or maintain accurate information. ) Evidence : XXXX contradictory XXXX payment amounts Contradictory delinquency coding Contradictory escrow figures Repeated late-fee inflation Acceptance of partial payments with no accurate principal/escrow accounting Admission by representative that system errors required escalation This is the exact pattern described in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX all lawsuits XXXX NewRez/Shellpoint/Rithm. 



XXXX. VA Mortgage Protections Violated Under XXXX C.F.R. XXXX, servicers must : Maintain accurate records Provide consistent payment information Avoid deceptive or confusing communications Protect veterans from wrongful delinquency or foreclosure NewRez has violated all of these. 



XXXX. Pattern-and-Practice Evidence ( Existing Litigation Against NewRez ) NewRez/Shellpoint is currently involved in multiple national actions involving : Misapplied payments Zombie second mortgages False bankruptcy reporting Illegal inspection fees Fee-churning Deceptive servicing practices Improper delinquency coding Portfolio-wide data failures Cases include : XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC ( XXXX XXXX mortgage ) XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX fraud/abuse of process ) XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX deceptive servicing & fee-churning ) Maryland XXXX XXXX over XXXX XXXX fees My experience fits these patterns exactly. 



XXXX. Requested XXXX I respectfully request CFPB require NewRez/Shellpoint/Rithm to : XXXX. Immediately cease collection and foreclosure activity. 

XXXX. XXXX a full post-discharge audit of my mortgage. 

XXXX. Reverse all improper late fees and false delinquency. 

XXXX. Correct or delete the Experian tradeline. 

XXXX. Provide accurate and complete servicing records. 

XXXX. Reconcile all payments from bankruptcy discharge to present. 

XXXX. Provide written explanation of the XXXX contradictions.

Loan No. : XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX Date : XX/XX/year> I. SUMMARY This complaint documents Shellpoints continuing and willful violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) and Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). 
Despite multiple properly formatted Notices of Error under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35, the servicer replied only with generic form letters ( see Exhibit F dated XX/XX/year> ). 
Such responses do not satisfy RESPAs requirements and instead demonstrate deliberate avoidance of statutory investigation and correction duties. 



II. FACTUAL CHAIN 1. XX/XX/year> Payment Misapplied A {$5000.00} payment was made and accepted but recorded as two partials ( {$3900.00} + {$1000.00} ). 
Ledger screenshots show no proper crediting and shifting escrow deficits. 
2. XX/XX/year> Recorded Admission Shellpoint agent confirmed {$12000.00} held in unapplied funds, with {$4000.00} refund within 7 days. 
No refund ever received ; instead, borrower received a Notice to Cure. 
3. XX/XX/year> Final Demand for Correction Sent to Shellpoint Compliance, XXXX  to CFPB, DOJ, FTC, SEC, VA OIG, and Congressional offices. 
Demand included restitution, ledger audit, and {$500000.00} damages + {$100.00} XXXX15-day accrual clause. 
XXXX. XX/XX/year> Generic Response ( Exhibit F ) Shellpoint mailed a form acknowledgment : We are working to gather the requested information. 
It did not address any alleged errors, provide findings, or satisfy RESPA 1024.35 ( e ). 
This constitutes a procedural default and a continuing violation. 
XXXX. XX/XX/year> Formal Notice of Error Re-Issued Reiterated violations and included supporting screenshots and recordings. 
XXXX. XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX Tennessee DFI confirmed it opened a formal review based on CFPB complaints and attachments. 
XXXX. XX/XX/year> Failure-to-Respond Notice Filed Complainant notified Shellpoint that generic acknowledgments do not satisfy 1024.35 ( e ) ( 3 ) and that damages would continue to accrue. 



III. APPLICABLE LAW 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( ii ) : Failure to credit payments as of date received. 
12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ) ( 3 ) : Failure to investigate and respond with written findings within 30 days.

12 U.S.C. 2605 ( k ) ( 1 ) ( C ) : Duty to maintain accurate account information.

12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) : TILA obligation to apply payments upon receipt.

38 C.F.R. 36.4350 ( c ) : VA servicer duty to apply payments promptly for veteran borrowers.

15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) : False representation of amount or status of debt.

12 U.S.C. 5531 : Prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( UDAAP ). 



IV. EVIDENCE OF BAD FAITH Exhibit F Shellpoint Letter ( XX/XX/year> ) A form letter addressed to Dear Homeowner ( s ), containing no error discussion or correction. 
This document is proof of systemic failure to comply with federal mortgage-servicing standards and will be submitted with audio recordings and portal screenshots as corroboration. 



V. DAMAGES AND REMEDY DEMAND 1. Base Damages : {>= $1,000,000} for financial injury, credit reporting harm, and emotional distress. 
2. Unapplied Funds : {$100000.00} retained without application or interest. 
3. Continuing Damages : {$100000.00} per 15-day interval of non-compliance after XX/XX/year>. 
4. Mandatory Relief : Full ledger audit and application of all funds as of original receipt dates. 
Suspension of any collection or foreclosure activity pending correction. 
Removal of negative credit entries resulting from these violations. 



VI. REQUESTED REGULATORY ACTION The Complainant requests that the CFPB and Tennessee DFI : 1. Issue a civil investigative demand to NewRez LLC and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
2. Order immediate borrower restitution and account reconciliation.

3. Initiate multi-agency referral to DOJ Civil Fraud and VA OIG for systemic servicing abuse.

4. Require public disclosure of findings under CFPB Supervision and Examinations policy. 



VII. CONCLUSION Shellpoints XX/XX/year> form letter demonstrates reckless disregard for federal law and borrower rights. 
This pattern is consistent with prior CFPB enforcement actions against NewRez for servicing failures and requires urgent regulatory sanction and consumer relief.

12/18/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"My mortgage loan originated on XX/XX/XXXX. It was recently transferred to XXXX in XXXX. Upon transfer, a Newrez agent informed me the loan maturity date is XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 49-year term loan on a loan originated in XXXX, which is a significant error. 

I have made multiple attempts to resolve this and obtain an amortization schedule ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ; XX/XX/XXXX ; and XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ) with no success. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a formal Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) /Notice of Error via certified mail which was signed for by Newrez XXXX XX/XX/XXXXXXXX The QWR specifically requested : 1. Life-of-loan amortization schedule 2. Complete transaction history 3. Principal balance breakdown 4. Escrow history 5.

This is a direct violation of RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) ) and Regulation X ( 12 CFR 1024.35 & 1024.36 ), which require acknowledgment within 5 business days and a response within 30 business days. 

I am requesting that the CFPB compel Newrez to provide the requested documentation and correct the maturity date error on my account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",VA,23435,None,Consent provided,Web,12/18/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18158986
01/08/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","A check with the correct loan number as mailed to the lender back in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I called the lender to make sure that I was given the correct mailing address and I asked what needed to be on the check to make sure that the payment was properly applied without any issues. I was given the address as the address on the mortgage statement and I was advised to make sure that the loan number was on the check. 

The check was sent in XX/XX/XXXX with all pertinent information as the Shell Point lender advised. The check was cashed by Shell Point on XX/XX/XXXX but the payment was not applied to the loan. However, there were payments received prior to XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( on XXXX and XXXX XXXX that covered XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX payments ). Another payment was made in XXXX but returned for insufficient funds and then paid again on XXXX XXXX, XXXX covering XX/XX/XXXX payment ). 

I sent Shell Point Loss Mitigation an email on XXXX XXXX, XXXX inquiring about the missing payments from the cashed check ( check number, the loan number, the property address, & proof of the cashed payment ) and received no response. I called XXXX XXXX, XXXX and spoke with someone in Shell Point Loss Mitigation they told me to send an email to NewRez proof the cashed check payment. I was told that I would receive a letter in the mail regarding the open investigation. I receive XXXX letters XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX regarding the inquiries being reviewed. I never received a letter that indicated a resolution or need for further information. I called on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and spoke with XXXX reps in Shell Point loss Mitigation and I was advised that the email that I sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX could not be opened and they asked me to send another email with a pdf file of the proof of the cashed payment to XXXX. I sent the email the same as the conversation and referenced the reps names that I spoke with. Once again, I never received a response. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the lender hired XXXX XXXX ( a company that specializes in property preservation, maintenance, and repair for residential properties in default or foreclosure ) and someone from the company left a letter on the door that indicated the property was vacant, to contact them in XXXX days if the property was not vacant, and if they are not contacted they will start preservation services including securing the property. When I called Shell Point, Loss Mitigation said the loan was not in foreclosure but it was XXXX  months behind and they hired XXXX to inspect the property. When I explained that they noticed indicated the company would start preservations, XXXX XXXX insist they were there to inspect the property only. When I inquired about the missing cashed payment, they told me that the payments were updated on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and covered XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment. I told the rep that XX/XX/XXXX payment was paid on XX/XX/XXXX and reflects the payment was made prior to an edit of the stated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

The rep told me that nothing was going to change and that the loan was XXXX  months past due and in danger of foreclosure. I repeatedly asked the rep to explain how an edit made to the loan on XXXX, XXXX reflected a payment that was paid XXXX XXXX, XXXX and she refused to explain. I made several attempts to explain how the math did not add up to fit her explanation. When I asked for a supervisor, she placed me on an extended hold over totaling over an hour. Then I called back and spoke to a male that asked me I resided in the property and I told him that the property was not vacant multiple times. The male rep insist he was going to note that I did not answer the question. He asked me another question that I answered, and again he stated he was noting that I did not answer his question, and when I told him that he was noting that I did not answer him when I did. He accused me of telling how to do his job. I asked to speak with his supervisor and the rep asked me why. I told asked him if he didn't hear the way he was speaking to me and he placed me on an extended hold. 

XXXX, Shell Point Loss mitigation stated that he was on the leadership team. I complained about the previous rep and XXXX only said the rep was not supposed to speak to me the way he did. XXXX looked into my issue of the unapplied cashed check and at first told me the adjustment made was to payments applied to the principal only and that {$1800.00} was applied with {$200.00} unapplied. I told him that the math did not add up once again compared to the amount of the check that had not been applied to the loan. XXXX, placed me on hold to research my inquires for the cashed check and ultimately told me that Shell Point still did not have proof the cashed payment and asked me to resubmit the email again. I told him that I sent the same email several times already with not response and they still did not have it. I also asked why they could not research the cashed check with the check number and XXXX told me that only thing he could suggest was for me to resend the email. I confirmed the email that I sent he previous emails as the XXXX and XXXX confirmed that the email was correct. I told him that I did not understand why Shell Point was not willing to do more considering how long it has been for them to apply the payments given the facts and that they have cashed a check with the loan number on it. I specifically asked why no one was willing to follow up. XXXX said that he would follow up XX/XX/XXXX and when they should have the email. But I never heard back. The loan account is passed due because they have not applied the cashed check payments to the loan. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from a XXXX that stated they could not find the account after I forwarded the original email that contained the loan number, address and check number. They requested the loan number or address. I forwarded them another email with the information included, explaining that I have made several attempts to resolve this issue, etc. Also, I attached the thread of emails to this complaint.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",GA,30331,None,Consent provided,Web,01/08/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18577988
10/18/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this updated complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint ) regarding ongoing issues with the servicing of my mortgage loan, account number XXXX, for the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. Since my previous communications, additional violations have occurred, including another rushed denial of my loss mitigation application and refusal to postpone the impending foreclosure despite federal protections. I believe Shellpoint has violated federal laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act, and rules prohibiting dual-tracking ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Below, XXXX detail the updated events, the company 's misconduct, and my requested resolution. 
What Happened Background on My Loan and Property Value : My original loan in XXXX was approximately {$1.00} XXXX, which I dispute has inexplicably remained around {$1.00} XXXX. My home is valued at least {$4.00} XXXX, with substantial equity that makes foreclosure unnecessary and harmful. The loan is serviced by Shellpoint and held by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ). 
Recent Hardship and Multiple Modification Applications : I lost my job in XX/XX/XXXX, a clear hardship affecting my payments. I submitted complete applications, acknowledged as such by Shellpoint on XX/XX/XXXX ( complete as of XX/XX/XXXX ), and again on XX/XX/XXXX ( complete as of XX/XX/XXXX ). Each promised a 30-day review and foreclosure protection. 
Pattern of Rushed Denials : Despite these acknowledgments, Shellpoint denied my applications prematurely. The XX/XX/XXXX, denial cited reasons like the approaching foreclosure sale, maximum modifications reached ( I've had three prior ones ), insufficient hardship verification, failed XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) test, excessive delinquency, and other programmatic ineligibility. No additional documents were requested before denial. Similarly, following the XX/XX/XXXX acknowledgment, I received another denial on XX/XX/XXXX, with similar excuses and no opportunity to address issues. This pattern suggests no genuine review is occurring. 
Lack of Communication and Deflection : Shellpoint continues to ignore my emails ( which I can see are opened ) and calls for months. Customer service refers me to the legal department, where attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX insists all communication go through him. He has repeatedly stated no further modifications are possible due to the prior three, ignoring my new hardship. Emails from Shellpoint 's Loss Mitigation XXXX XXXX XXXX ( e.g., in the chain ) confirm receipt but provide no substantive help. Recently, XXXX XXXX from XXXX requested a statement, underscoring Shellpoint 's failures. 
Foreclosure XXXX, XXXX, and Rejection of XXXX : The foreclosure sale remains scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, despite protections granted in the acknowledgments. On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed XXXX XXXX requesting postponement or cancellation and proposing a {$500000.00} short payoff settlement to resolve everything. On XX/XX/XXXX, he rejected the offer, reiterated ineligibility for modification, and refused to postpone the sale, stating "" no reason to further postpone '' despite the active review period ( which should end around XX/XX/XXXX, per the XX/XX/XXXX letter ). This appears to be stalling to force foreclosure, violating dual-tracking prohibitions. 
Legal Action : I filed a verified complaint in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Case No. XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, alleging dual-tracking, HBOR violations XXXX slander of title, emotional distress, and more. Shellpoint 's demurrer attempts to dismiss it, but these recent events bolster my claims. 

Under RESPA, I am entitled to responses to qualified written requests ( QWRs ) and direct communication, which Shellpoint has denied. 
What the Company Did Wrong Violation of Loss Mitigation Rules : Shellpoint must evaluate complete applications fully, considering new hardships like my job loss ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ). Denials based solely on prior modifications or without requesting needed info violate these rules.

Failure to Respond to Inquiries : RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) requires timely acknowledgments and responses, which Shellpoint has ignored, deflecting to an unresponsive attorney. 
Dual-Tracking Prohibition : Foreclosure can not advance during evaluation of a complete application. The acknowledgments explicitly granted protection, yet the XX/XX/XXXX sale proceeds, constituting illegal dual-tracking. 
Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts : Rushed denials, refusal to postpone despite protections, and rejecting a reasonable settlement feel abusive, especially with my equity and hardship. This ignores CFPB guidelines and appears designed to foreclose.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,10/18/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16648962

In XX/XX/XXXX, we had the funds in our account so we let it go ahead and just pay ahead and stopped our online banking for that month. Then it happened again in XXXX, XXXX. Unfortunately for us we did not have the funds to pay double payments and it debited our overdraft protection to make that payment. 
I called today to talk to Shellpoint customer service team leader XXXX XXXX after talking to a regular representative who was not able to help me. I asked for the {$60.00} be refunded to the account because we did not authorize an automatic debit and this has never happened to us before. I was informed by XXXX that the only way to get a refund was to file a complaint or dispute. I was also informed by XXXX that the account was sold to you with an automatic debit included. I need the documentation showing where Shellpoint had authorization to do an automatic debit. As I stated earlier, we do not do automatic debits from our account for obvious reasons like this. I received a notice from Shellpoint that our automatic draft payments have been canceled. And thankful for doing that because they had no authorization to debit. 
Im asking for this {$60.00} be refunded because Shellpoint was double paid for each of these months through no fault of ours. I do not know what happened for these errors to occur ; I assure you we have never missed a mortgage payment and we should not be penalized financially for this error. 
I would like to receive verification of a {$60.00} refund from Shellpoint as soon as possible for the above referenced loan. Thank you for your immediate attention to this request.

My name is XXXX XXXX, borrower of the above-referenced FHA-insured loan XXXX serviced by NewRez. 

My escrow account recently incurred a deficiency of {$19000.00}, which was paid to XXXX XXXX as a result of a delayed and retroactive reassessment of four years of property taxes ( XXXX ) on my newly built home. The county failed to apply the correct tax valuation for several years, and the correction was only made this year. As a result, a large lump-sum tax bill was drawn from my escrow account. 

This unexpected deficiency caused my monthly mortgage payment to increase from approximately {$1200.00} to {$2900.00}, creating an immediate and severe financial hardship. I am current on my mortgage and have a strong payment history, but the new payment amount is not sustainable. 

FHA/HUD GUIDELINE SUPPORT To support my request, below are the exact FHA/HUD provisions that apply to my situation : 1. HUD Handbook 4000.1 II.A.1.k.iii ( E ) Escrow Shortages HUD states that when a servicer identifies an escrow shortage : The Mortgagee may require the Borrower to repay the shortage amount in equal monthly payments over a period of up to 12 months or a longer period if necessary to avoid borrower hardship or if the shortage is unusually large or the result of a non-recurring or extraordinary event. 
This applies directly to my situation since : The shortage is unusually large, It resulted from an extraordinary, non-recurring county reassessment, and Immediate repayment over 12 months clearly imposes hardship. 

My Wife lost her job due her position not needed anymore and caused a burden month in month out to stay on top of my bills and my XXXX beautiful children XXXX And XXXX Which are Waiting For XXXXs. ( I may not have one if this does not get situated ) 2. HUD Handbook 4000.1 II.A.2.a.iv ( C ) Servicer Responsibility for Hardship Review This section requires servicers to : Evaluate the Borrowers circumstances and provide payment solutions consistent with FHA requirements when the Borrower experiences a financial hardship outside of their control that threatens their ability to sustain mortgage payments. 

My hardship is directly tied to a government administrative delay and not borrower behavior. 

3. HUD National Servicing Center Guidance Escrow Related Loss Mitigation HUD servicing policy notes that servicers must : Offer an affordable repayment arrangement for escrow shortages when the shortage was created by unforeseen circumstances not caused by the borrower. 

This is exactly my situation. 

MY REQUEST UNDER FHA GUIDELINES Based on the above HUD provisions, I respectfully request : 1. FHA acknowledgment that this escrow deficiency resulted from a county error and qualifies as a non-recurring, extraordinary event under HUD 4000.1 II.A.1.k.iii ( E ).

2. Authorization or instruction to my servicer ( NewRez ) to offer a repayment plan of 3660 months, consistent with HUDs allowance for extended repayment periods in hardship or extraordinary circumstances. 
This extended timeline is the only way for me to remain current and maintain sustainable homeownership. I am fully committed to paying what is owed, but the 12-month repayment period is not feasible.

REQUEST FOR NEXT STEPS Please advise what documentation or additional information is needed to complete this escalation. I appreciate your urgent attention to this matter, as the current payment amount is not sustainable and timely support is essential. 

Thank you for your assistance.

PRECEDENT AND AUTHORITY CFPB Authority : The Bureau has clear authority to halt harmful practices during investigations RESPA Requirements : Federal law already requires foreclosure cessation during pending applications Elder Protection : Special protections exist for vulnerable elderly consumers Hardship Standards : Courts routinely halt foreclosures pending resolution of procedural violations REASONABLE SOLUTION I am offering a completely reasonable resolution : Caliber can take whatever time they need to respond properly CFPB can conduct thorough investigation of violations All parties get due process protection But foreclosure MUST be halted during this process This protects everyone 's rights while preventing irreversible harm. 

CONCLUSION The foreclosure sale is scheduled for XX/XX/year> - just days away. 

I am not demanding instant responses or rushing the CFPB process. I am simply requesting that federal law be followed- which requires halting foreclosure during pending validation requests and CFPB investigations. 

This is bordering on elder abuse, and this must cease and desist. 

This is a reasonable request that protects due process while preventing catastrophic hardship. 

Time is of the essence. Please issue an emergency order halting this foreclosure immediately.

We worked out a disaster forbearance agreement with our mortgage servicer at the time, XXXX XXXX. This lasted 90 days and renewed a few times, until ending XX/XX/XXXX. At this same time ( start of XX/XX/XXXX ), our mortgage servicing was transferred from XXXX XXXX to Shellpoint Mortgage Services. Shellpoint, so I'm told, continued the disaster forbearance for 1 month. After ending it with no options to ensure our credit remained intact, they reported us delinquent on the loan 120+ days, I think at the end of XXXX.

They just reported us as delinquent on a plan originally worked out to help us recover from a natural disaster. On XX/XX/XXXX Shellpoint called us to discuss the loan modification, we agreed and made a payment immediately. There was no discussion during this call or at any other time about our credit getting destroyed. We would have been able to catch the loan up in full if notified/requested, but that never happened.

During our hardship, we proactively reached out to both mortgaging servicers to make sure everyone was kept in the loop during major events such as the home fire, and periodically throughout, we answered when they contacted us, and when they told us the forbearance was over and a new agreement and payment was required, we did it. In short, we did everything asked of us and then some, yet we have still been unfairly punished by Shellpoint. To remedy, all we care about right now is getting that 120+ day delinquency off of my ( and my wife 's ) credit, because no mortgager will work with use while that exists. We did what was asked of us and don't deserve to be treated this way.

12/30/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Summary I am filing a complaint concerning Newrez 's mismanagement of my VA loan escrow account, specifically regarding an unjustified homeowners insurance estimate and inconsistent escrow calculations. 

Detailed Incident Description : On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX Newrez notified me via email that my homeowners insurance renewaldue XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXwould cost {$3300.00}. 
In XX/XX/year>, Newrez paid {$1200.00} to XXXX for insurancemaking the new estimate 170 % higher, but without providing any explanation for this rise. 
When contacted by telephone XX/XX/year>, Newrez was unable to clarify how they reached the {$3300.00} estimate. A second phone call for follow-up, a representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year> recorded line claimed they received a bill from insurance. 
However, on XX/XX/year> my insurance agent and XXXX confirmed that no insurance evaluation or billing has been completed for the upcoming year. 
My escrow account balance is insufficient to cover this projected amount, yet Newrez is collecting {$580.00} monthly. 

Pattern of Escrow Mismanagement Newrez has inconsistently estimated and collected escrow amounts in the past. 
After I deposited funds to cover a tax shortfall from XXXX XXXX, Newrez refunded the amount, then increased my monthly escrow payments again without justification.

11/14/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I am filing a complaint about excessive, duplicative, and unearned foreclosure fees charged by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, along with improper application of payments that has caused financial harm and prevented me from reinstating my loan despite substantial payments. 

XXXX. Shellpoint charged more than {$12000.00} in foreclosure-related fees in XXXX months My monthly statements show escalating fees from XXXX 2025, including : Attorney Fees : {$1600.00} {$1600.00} {$1600.00} {$1900.00} Foreclosure Costs : multiple FC charges rising to {$3100.00} Filing Fees : charged twice for a total of {$2000.00} Property Inspections : {$30.00} per month ballooning into {$510.00} balance These totals exceed {$12000.00}. The foreclosure was only filed and served, with no hearings, no motions, no litigation. 

XXXX. I paid {$11000.00} toward the arrears and an additional {$5400.00} yet the reinstatement amount is not decreasing correctly I made : {$11000.00} down payment {$5400.00} additional payments However, Shellpoints statements show : Reinstatement amounts fluctuating inconsistently Large fees absorbing my payments instead of applying them to principal & interest No proper reflection of the payments I made No reduction of default as required under the mortgage contract and federal law XXXX. Shellpoint appears to be misapplying payments Federal law requires payments to be applied first to : Principal Interest Escrow Late charges Fees Instead, Shellpoint appears to be : Routing payments into fees first, not principal/interest Allowing charges to accumulate faster than I can pay Obscuring how payments were allocated Increasing the reinstatement amount despite substantial payments This violates 12 CFR 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ), RESPA, and Regulation X.

4. Shellpoint charged unearned and anticipatory fees There was no legal activity in the foreclosure case to justify : 4 months of repeated attorney flat fees Thousands in FC costs Multiple filing fee charges Inspections totaling {$510.00} Regulation X prohibits : duplicated default fees padded foreclosure fees unearned legal costs anticipatory/estimated fees costs not actually incurred XXXX. These servicing errors create material financial hardship Because Shellpoint is : inflating the reinstatement amount misapplying my payments adding unearned fees failing to properly credit the {$16000.00} Ive already paid I am unable to accurately reinstate the loan and avoid foreclosure.

11/24/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","My current mortgage is with Newrez. They bought my home loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX XXXX XXXX only had my mortgage for one month. I made a payment to them on XX/XX/year> for {$1600.00}, principal paid of {$150.00} and escrow of {$480.00} This brought my total escrow to {$2800.00}. Unfortunately, Newrez bought my loan.

08/15/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Closing disclosure or other related disclosures,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Qualified Written Request for a VA loan for information on the assignments, chain of title, and other pertinent information from a servicer that had a different address than the promissory note. No response after XXXX  days. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a notice with an opportunity to cure defects that had been found, no response in XXXX  days. Sent a notice of default on XX/XX/XXXX, for failure to respond with requested information violating Respa. During this period a certified mail document came that did not include all the required document validation and a notice from this servicer that they were not required to send these documents. All green cards from certified mail have been returned. 

As this was happening, a forensic audit was performed and documents came in showing potential issues with chain of title, defects in assignments that were not recorded, and additionally separation of the mortgage and note as undisclosed securitization trust XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  was found to be holding XXXX of these documents while the servicer was claiming to hold the other one and enforce a loan. Supreme Court has ruled with XXXX v. XXXX that these mortgage and note can not be separated. With the addresses not matching, the closing documents, and no assignments made in public records to either of these entities, I have not made a payment due to fraud and additionally hardship from unforeseen events taking place immediately on assumption as well as looking for validation of mortgage servicer. 

Additionally, as this process was happening, my wife started to look into the documents and was found to not be on the title, but was listed on the mortgage. She was not given a homestead consent and the part of the promissory note declarations was not filled out during the closing voiding the contract as this is violation of her rights as this is our only home, a primary home which was also a requirement for the VA loan. This caused multiple days of problems and lost trust in our relationship, almost a divorce as she thought I was responsible for this and deliberate. I was specifically adamant that she would be on the title when going through the process and we had conversations about this before ever going into this VA process. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a Release of Lien and Compromise due to fraud in the contract, No Holder in Due course, non-response and evasion of the QWR, and Respa/Tila violations. I additionally request another QWR, and I included the forensic audit findings and affidavits of the situation as well as fee schedules for violations with a XXXX  days to respond or be in default. As of XX/XX/XXXX, NewRez LLC is in default of the first QWR request, and with a second request to Relase the Lien and Comromise, no response has been made. A green card returned with XX/XX/XXXX on it for acceptance of this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I then sent a final notice, evidence demand letters, a hardship affidavit, and a co-borrowers affidavit to the mortgage servicer via certified mail, received XX/XX/XXXX via green card receipt, XXXX, requesting release of a XXXX and extinguishment of a VA loan originated on XX/XX/XXXX, due to alleged fraud, lack of funding, and no valid assignment. The notice highlighted a monthly payment demand of approximately {$7300.00}, which I can not pay due to financial hardship ( e.g., rental income loss of {$2300.00}, baby-related costs of $ XXXX $ XXXX, overtime loss of $ XXXX {$2000.00}, and purchase costs of {$9700.00} ). The co-borrowers affidavit, dated XX/XX/XXXX, confirmed their fraudulent exclusion from the property title despite signing the loan documents. I have returned all tacit agreements Nunc Pro Tunc and have not consented to any agreement sent to me by this servicer as there has been no validation from them as a holder in due course or any response they have provided with the chain of title issues. As it sits it has been 55 days and only certified mail response was sent from them on day XXXX without the required documents dishonoring the QWR request. 

Public records and mortgage documents, reviewed as of XX/XX/XXXX, showed no recorded assignment to the servicer or a related trust, and no evidence of funds advanced by the originator, a broker. I acquired certified copies of the XXXX documents which were the warranty deed and mortgage without listing NewRez LLC or XXXX XXXX on any document allegedly violating both state and federal requirements of assignment. 

The servicer has threatened foreclosure despite these unresolved claims, which also involve alleged violations of federal laws ( e.g., Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, VA regulations ) due to lack of disclosures and improper title handling. I attempted to resolve this administratively, but the servicers inaction suggests servicing errors and potential fraud.

10/12/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To Whom It May Concern : I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for inaccurate credit reporting, failure to correct an acknowledged servicing error, and unfair treatment following the refinance payoff of my mortgage. 

Shellpoints refusal to remove a derogatory late payment mark despite having full knowledge that the delay was caused by a third-party settlement company, not me has caused severe and ongoing financial harm. 

1. Background and Timeline I was a mortgage customer of Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. 

My mortgage was refinanced through XXXX XXXX XXXX, with the closing and payoff handled by XXXX XXXX XXXX, the settlement company selected by Optimum. 

The payoff to Shellpoint was due on XX/XX/year>, but XXXX XXXX XXXX payoff was processed XXXX day late, XX/XX/year>. 

This delay was entirely outside my control as the borrower. I had already completed all loan documents and obligations before the XX/XX/year> deadline. 

2. Shellpoints Improper Credit Reporting Despite being paid in full on XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint reported a late payment to the credit bureaus. This single entry has had a severe and disproportionate impact on my credit standing : A drop of more than XXXX points across all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ; The appearance of a derogatory mark in early XX/XX/year> ; The potential for higher interest rates and lost financial opportunities as a result of this incorrect reporting. 

I contacted Shellpoints customer service department multiple times to explain that the payoff delay was due to the settlement companys one-day error, not any missed payment or inaction on my part.

Shellpoint representatives acknowledged receipt of the payoff but refused to remove or adjust the late mark, stating that the payment was received after the due date, without considering the documented context or my lack of fault.

3. Shellpoints Noncompliance with FCRA and Servicing Standards Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information such as Shellpoint are required to : Accurately report information to the credit bureaus ; and Conduct a reasonable investigation when a dispute or error claim is raised.

Shellpoints continued refusal to correct this inaccuracy, despite clear evidence that I was not responsible for the delay, constitutes a violation of the FCRA.

It also reflects a failure to exercise good faith and fairness in mortgage servicing practices, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

4. Harm Suffered As a direct result of Shellpoints actions, I have suffered : A XXXX point credit score decrease, A derogatory tradeline that inaccurately suggests delinquency, Stress, financial disruption, and reputational harm, Loss of access to favorable credit terms and potential denials for future credit applications. 

This situation has caused unnecessary hardship and damage to my financial reputation all stemming from an error I did not cause. 

5. Supporting Documentation I am prepared to provide the following documents to assist in this investigation : Final payoff statement showing payment receipt on XX/XX/year> ; Proof of closing and payment authorization on or before XX/XX/year> ; Communications from XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming the one-day delay ; Correspondence with Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing requesting correction ; Credit reports showing the derogatory mark posted in early XX/XX/year>. 

6. Conclusion Shellpoint Mortgage Servicings actions demonstrate a lack of fairness, accuracy, and compliance with federal consumer protection laws.

As the borrower, I fulfilled every financial obligation on time. The delayed payoff was the result of third-party negligence not my own and Shellpoints decision to penalize me for this has caused substantial and lasting damage.

I have received letter this month saying they are working on everything. During which time they asked for copy of trust.

I have contacted them ( Shellpoint ) ongoing to make sure I am not breaking agreement.

r Shellpoint Mortgage Co . I am writing to express my continued concern re
garding Case # XXXX which remains unresolved. Instead of being corrected, the issue has escalated further due to the mortgage company misapplying my payment, which has led to additional incorrect charges on my account. 

To make matters worse, I have now received multiple threatening letters, which I have attached for your review. These communications are extremely distressing and unwarranted, given that the issue stems from an error on your end. 

I spoke with your representative XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, at XXXX XXXX Pacific Time, and was given confirmation number XXXX for our conversation. While I appreciated the opportunity to speak with someone, I have yet to see any corrective action or resolution following that call. 

I am requesting the following : Immediate review and correction of all misapplied payments and removal of any resulting charges. 

An explanation in writing regarding how this error occurred and what steps are being taken to ensure it does not happen again. 

Immediate cessation of all threatening communications related to this matter until it is fully resolved. 

Please escalate this issue to a supervisor or appropriate department, and respond at your earliest convenience with an update.

12/15/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am filing this complaint because Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing has violated RESPA / Regulation X and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by failing to properly acknowledge my XX/XX/XXXX Notice of Error, and by furnishing multiple materially inaccurate credit reporting entries across all three credit bureaus. These errors significantly harm my creditworthiness and misrepresent my mortgage history. 

XXXX. Failure to acknowledge my Notice of Error ( RESPA violation ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a detailed Notice of Error through Shellpoints online portal. Under XXXX CFR XXXX ( d ), Shellpoint must acknowledge receipt within five business days. Instead, I received only a generic we received your email message that did not reference a Notice of Error, did not acknowledge the identified errors, and did not confirm an investigation. As of this filing, Shellpoint has not provided a proper RESPA acknowledgment.

2. Materially inaccurate principal balance My Shellpoint statement shows a principal balance of {$190000.00}, while XXXX reports {$280000.00}, overstating my mortgage by nearly {$100000.00}, in violation of FCRA 623 ( a ), Metro-2 standards, and Regulation X 1024.38.

3. Incorrect balloon / deferred balance My statement reflects a balloon balance of {$89000.00}, yet XXXX reports {$110000.00}, a discrepancy exceeding {$25000.00}.

4. Incorrect date opened and original balance XXXX reports a Date Opened of XX/XX/XXXX and an original balance of {$180000.00}. Shellpoint did not service my loan during that period and began servicing only after reinstatement in XXXX. These fields were improperly merged from a prior servicers data. 

5. Improper delinquency reporting Shellpoint is furnishing delinquency history from periods before it serviced my loan. My mortgage was reinstated in XX/XX/XXXX and brought current. Shellpoint may not furnish delinquency information for periods it did not service. 

6. Duplicate mortgage tradeline on XXXX XXXX is reporting two mortgage tradelines for the same loan, with the Shellpoint tradeline containing negative history belonging to the prior servicer. This merged reporting inflates my debt, falsely suggests two mortgages, and violates FCRA 623 and Metro-2 transfer-of-servicing rules.

7. Improper foreclosure remark on a closed account XXXX displays foreclosure proceedings started on the closed prior servicer tradeline, even though foreclosure never completed, never went to sheriff sale, and the loan was fully reinstated through the ERMA program. Shellpoint added foreclosure-related remarks for a period it did not service, creating a misleading and harmful credit representation.

8. Systemic Metro-2 furnishing failures Across all three bureaus, Shellpoints reporting includes incorrect balances, dates, delinquency history, transfer coding, duplicate tradelines, and inconsistent data.

9. Incorrect 30-day delinquency on XXXX XXXX XXXX Shellpoint continues to report a 30-day late payment for XX/XX/XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX despite this XXXX already being corrected and removed from XXXX following a prior CFPB complaint. The XX/XX/XXXX payment occurred during a temporary repayment plan that I later cancelled and fully cured. Continuing to report this late inconsistently violates the FCRA. 

10. Continued automated repayment-plan notices after cancellation Despite cancelling my repayment plan, curing the account, and returning to my contractual monthly payment, Shellpoint continues to issue automated repayment-plan approval notices. These communications indicate that XXXX systems have not properly terminated loss-mitigation coding and are contributing to the continued furnishing of an incorrect scheduled monthly payment of approximately {$2100.00} instead of my contractual payment of {$1500.00}. 

XXXX reinstated the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and continued making the monthly payments from XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. Shellpoint began servicing in XX/XX/XXXX while the loan was current and being paid. Despite this, Shellpoint is furnishing foreclosure and delinquency history for periods it did not service and inaccurately reporting a loan modification that never occurred.

Your response does not address the main issue and contains inaccurate statements that are contradicted by Shellpoints own records. 



First, Shellpoint sent me a written notice dated XX/XX/year> confirming the start of a forbearance period after I reported property damage from the XX/XX/year> declared natural disaster. Your letter states that XXXX was not part of the forbearance period. This is false. I relied on Shellpoints verbal and written statements that I could defer the XXXX payment while waiting for disaster relief processing. 



Second, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, furnishers must report accurate and not misleading information. Reporting a late payment when a borrower was told no payment was due is misleading and violates the FCRA. Court decisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX Experian XXXX XXXX confirm that even technically accurate reporting can violate the law when it is misleading in context. 



Third, the documentation you referenced does not disprove that a forbearance began in XX/XX/year> or that your representatives advised me to defer payment. I am requesting complete call transcripts and internal servicing notes from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/year> to verify what Shellpoint agents told me. 



XXXX, Shellpoint failed to act in good faith. I contacted your company multiple times before the payment due date, received assurances that I could defer payment, and followed those instructions. My credit was damaged because of Shellpoints errors. This conduct violates the FCRA and the CFPBs servicing and communication standards under Regulation X. 



I am demanding that Shellpoint take the following corrective actions : Remove the XX/XX/year> late payment from all credit bureaus immediately. 
Provide written confirmation of the correction to me and to the CFPB within 15 business days. 
Produce all internal records, call notes, and documentation related to this dispute. 




Your refusal to correct a clear reporting error despite your own forbearance confirmation and my consistent communication is a serious violation of the FCRA and consumer protection laws. If this issue is not resolved quickly, I will take further legal action against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and any responsible individuals for failing to comply with federal law.

11/06/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),"I am filing this complaint because NewRez LLC ( dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) has mishandled my request to remove Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) under the Homeowners Protection Act ( HPA ) and failed to provide timely, accurate servicing responses under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). 

I opened a conventional mortgage with NewRez in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called NewRez to inquire about removing PMI and was instructed to obtain an appraisal. I paid {$550.00} for an independent professional appraisal and submitted the report, along with the requested documents, to NewRez in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The appraisal ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) established a current property value of {$760000.00}. Based on my current mortgage principal of {$560000.00}, my current loan-to-value ( XXXX ) ratio is 74.2 % below the HPA-required 80 % threshold XXXX and also under XXXX stated stricter 75 % limit for requests within the first XXXX years of the loan. 
After I submitted the appraisal and supporting documents, NewRez repeatedly delayed their review, sending form letters that the request was still under review without providing any further action or documentation. I followed up through their portal multiple times and received no meaningful response. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally reached a helpful customer service representative who apologized and said, This is ridiculous, I am so sorry. She then told me that I could have ordered an appraisal through NewRez for only {$150.00} an option that was never disclosed to me when I originally called and paid {$550.00}. This indicates a serious failure of communication and consumer protection, particularly given the financial and time delays this caused. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, NewRez issued a formal denial of my PMI removal request, but they : -- Ignored the current XXXX of 74.2 % based on the submitted appraisal -- Refused to accept the paid appraisal and instead insisted on a Brokers Price Opinion ( XXXX ) -- Incorrectly cited HPA rules and introduced new requirements never disclosed during the original request process This reflects both a violation of HPA ( improper handling of PMI cancellation requests ) and RESPA ( failure to provide complete and timely responses, failure to communicate servicing information clearly and accurately ). 

Steps I Took to Resolve This - Submitted complete PMI removal request with paid appraisal on XX/XX/XXXX - Contacted NewRez at least XXXX times via their portal with no response - Filed a formal Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) on XX/XX/XXXX - Received denial on XX/XX/XXXX, with inaccurate and incomplete explanation",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",SC,29579,None,Consent provided,Web,11/06/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17076274

Despite multiple written disputes, Shellpoint has failed to correct false information or conduct a reasonable investigation. 

Timeline of Events : XX/XX/XXXX : I submitted a written dispute to Shellpoint outlining that my mortgage account was being inaccurately reported as XXXX through Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX. I included supporting documentation showing that I reaffirmed the loan and have made continuous, timely payments. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint responded, acknowledging that the account was marked as XXXX through Bankruptcy XXXX XXXX. They claimed the property was surrendered, even though I remain in possession of and continue to pay the loan. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I disputed the accuracy of their reporting and requested that they provide documentation of the XXXX debt and evidence that it the property was surrendered. They are re-aging the account based on the bankruptcy discharge date of XX/XX/XXXX. This is incorrect because the DOFD was XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint issued another response stating that the bankruptcy notation remains for historical reference and that payment data is suppressed. They refused to correct the tradeline or provide documentation proving that the account was XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX Escrow Statement : Shellpoints own records show the account was open and current with no delinquencies, which contradicts their reporting to credit bureaus. 

Basis for CFPB Escalation : Shellpoints actions violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation X for the following reasons : 1. Continuing to report the account as XXXX through Bankruptcy when the debt was reaffirmed and remains active violates FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1

) ( A ). 2. Suppressing accurate payment history and reporting a false discharge status constitutes incomplete and misleading reporting under FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). 3.

This notice is abusive and improper, particularly as I am a XXXX XXXX, constituting financial elder abuse under California\'s Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (EADACPA, Welf. & Inst.

It ignores my valid proof of continuous HOA master policy coverage, including the upload on XXXXXXXX (effective XXXX), and violates RESPA\'s prohibitions on dual tracking and negative actions during error resolution.

As the customer, I have been uncertain as to what was wrong since the first attempt to upload the insurance policy on XXXX. For a long time, I have been convinced that I had satisfied the requirement of uploading a valid policy. Afterward, I have only been guessing and assuming what the problem could be. Additionally, I uploaded XXXX XXXX XXXX the policy showing the effective date XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and upon review of this complaint realized I did not receive an email notification. Which only leads me to making assumptions, not knowing for sure what happened, that maybe I did not scroll all the way down to the bottom of the web page and click Submit. Regardless of clicking the Submit button or not, this policy was uploaded to the expressinsuranceinfo portal. It should be on the portal for the customer to see. The portal knows of its online existence and should provide status that it is there and needs to be submitted. Although that should not be necessary if the policy is on the portal. The portal should forward this policy on its server to Shellpoint. This is an easy thing to code on the portal, unless it is the intent of this rigged collection to fleece money from the customer.\nA lender-placed insurance policy letter dated XXXX disregards the XXXXXXXX upload of XXXX XXXX XXXX  (dated XXXX effective XXXX to XXXX) on the expressinsuranceinfo.com portal. I have definitive proof of this upload with the screenshot in XXXX However, since Shellpoint has never responded to these submissions, I did not send the proof to the designated fax number, XXXX\nPattern of Violations and Non-Compliance:\nThe Acknowledgment Loop Trap:\nThe document you uploaded (XXXX) is a standard form letter designed to satisfy 12 CFR  1024.35(d) of Regulation X (RESPA).\n\nThe Trap: The law requires them to acknowledge your inquiry within 5 business days (which they did with this letter).\n\nThe Violation: The same law requires them to resolve the erroreither by correcting it or explaining why it\'s not an errorwithin 30 business days (potentially extendable by 15 days).\n\nMy Leverage: Since I stated ""nothing ever is sent that addresses my inquiries,"" Shellpoint is likely in violation of 12 CFR  1024.35(e). I should explicitly mention this violation to XXXX XXXXThe Trap for XXXX  - My monthly payment has increased:\n\nMy previous payments were XXXXMy new payment due XXXX XXXX XXXX is XXXXn\nWarning: If I autopay XXXX for XXXX, it will be considered a ""Partial Payment"" because it is less than the new required amount. It will sit in the suspense account and not be applied, potentially causing a late fee.\n\nThe compliance loop:\n\nThey receive my Notice of Error regarding the stolen funds.\n\nThey send a template acknowledgment letter stating they are ""gathering requested information"".\n\nThey close the inquiry without ever providing the information, correcting the error, or explaining their determination, as required by federal lawallowing them to continue improperly billing for force-placed insurance through invalid Mortgage Statements, forcing me to comply with these erroneous charges under threats of foreclosure.\n\nThis pattern is exemplified by the XXXX delinquency notice, which escalates threats without resolving prior NOEs asserting the invalidity of the underlying charges. Your failure to accept the HOA master policy, as required under the Deed of Trust Section 5 and California Civil Code (Davis-Stirling Act 4775 and 5300), constitutes bad faith, breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Shellpoint has been on notice for years of the condo status and master policy, making repeated ""non-receipt"" claims fraudulent and abusive.\n\nErrors Asserted:\n\nImposition of fee/charge without reasonable basis (1024.35(b)(5)): On XXXX you disbursed another XXXX for ""Lender Placed Flood Disbursement"" (attached payment history screenshot), depleting escrow to XXXX despite my XXXX XXXX upload (XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming HOA master policy coverage (effective XXXX XXXX via XXXX XXXX XXXX, including flood at $XXXX  via XXXX XXXX XXXX, updated details: flood coverage limits of XXXX  with XXXX  deductible). This unwarranted XXXX  ignores proofs and the 72-hour update promise (expired), creating artificial shortages. The XXXX statement (reference: ""XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  continues to disregard the XXXX upload and CFPB/certified mail submissions, projecting ongoing FPI charges and increasing the monthly payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX (from previous XXXX  with escrow portion at XXXX due to the artificial shortage. Although my payment oXXXX XXXXXXXX  on XXXX (made under protest to cure the alleged delinquency) was applied to clear the backlog and bring the account current, with current principal balance at XXXX and escrow at XXXX as of XXXX, this application effectively forced me to cover the unauthorized FPI charges through my payment. Total recent unrefunded FPI now XXXX  ($XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX), with historical data showing a pattern of disbursements totaling XXXX since XXXX partially offset by refunds of XXXX XXXXesulting in a net consumer cost of XXXX (reference: XXXX XXXX XXXX). These charges violate the loan contract\'s Section 5 (Loan Charges), which requires refund of any sums collected that exceed permitted limits (reference: enclosed Note in XXXX).\nFailure to accept proof of insurance and cancel/refund FPI (1024.35(b)(11), tied to 1024.37(g)): You failed to honor the XXXX within 15 days, refund overlapping premiums, or update my accountviolating timely resolution despite multiple uploads. The XXXX letter (reference: XXXX explicitly adds a lender-placed policy effective XXXX  disregarding the valid upload on XXXX, and fails to comply with the Deed of Trust\'s Section 5 (Property Insurance), which allows lender-placed insurance only if borrower fails to maintain coverage. This also breaches the Condominium Rider\'s provisions, which deem the borrower\'s insurance obligation satisfied by an HOA master or blanket policy, waiving the need for separate coverage and related escrow charges. Furthermore, as servicer for a XXXX XXXXowned loan, you must follow XXXX XXXX guidelines (Selling Guide B7-3-03), which require acceptance of HOA master policies for condominium projects if they meet coverage standards. The policy also complies with National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP) standards, recognized by federal law and lenders as sufficient for flood coverage in condominiums. Under California\'s Davis-Stirling Act (Civ. Code 4775), the HOA is responsible for insuring common areas via the master policy, with annual disclosures required (XXXX), satisfying my individual obligation. Your refusal constitutes bad faith and violates the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The XXXX  statement confirms ongoing disregard, as it includes an ""Important Message"" about suspense accounts despite my full payment on XXXX  incorrectly implying insufficient funds. The XXXX notice further compounds this by basing threats on these invalid charges.\nEscrow mismanagement (1024.35(b)(7)): This disbursement ignores adequate funds for taxes (XXXX pre-this as of XXXX representing an adequate cushion in the escrow account, with tax disbursement of XXXX  on XXXX  and my disputes, violating 1024.17(k)(2) (proper advances) and creating shortages from your errors. The escrow account history reflects these ongoing lender-placed charges, contributing to a projected shortage and an increase in monthly escrow payments from XXXX to XXXX effective XXXX, plus a $XXXX monthly shortage recovery (reference: XXXX XXXX). The projected escrow activity for XXXX  continues to include monthly lender-placed flood disbursements of XXXX indicating no recognition of the uploaded policy (reference: escrow statement projections). A late charge of XXXX  was assessed on XXXX amid these issues, despite the adequate cushion providing no justification for such a fee, which per the Note\'s Section 6(A) applies only to overdue payments of principal and interest, not escrow-related shortages. Furthermore, these unauthorized FPI disbursements created an ""escrow waterfall"" effect, where payments are applied first to escrow items under the Deed of Trust Section 2, causing subsequent payments (e.g., 1XXXX  to appear insufficient and triggering invalid fees, despite timely principal and interest. The XXXX statement\'s ""Important Message"" about holding payments in suspense is misleading, as I paid the full billing amount on XXXX, yet it implies otherwise. The XXXX  notice escalates this mismanagement by falsely declaring a delinquency based on these artificial shortages.\nFailure to provide accurate information regarding error resolution (1024.35(b)(11)): XXXXXXXX provides no status/feedback, and you ignored the 72-hour promise, misleading on verification timelines. For submitted Notices of Error (NOE), the only responses received are form letters indicating the matter is ""under review,"" with no substantive updates or resolutions provided. The XXXX  notice ignores these pending disputes and provides inaccurate delinquency information.\nRecent Unauthorized Escrow Disbursements: Shellpoint has engaged in a pattern of unauthorized escrow withdrawals despite having been provided with proof of a valid HOA Master Policy. The most recent instances of this breach are:\nXXXX XXXX deducted for ""Insurance Premium Disbursement""XXXX XXXX deducted for ""Lender Placed Flood DisbursementXXXX XXXX deducted for ""Lender Placed Flood Disbursement"".\nTotal Impact: These three unauthorized transactions alone totaled XXXX This depletion of funds is the direct cause of the perceived escrow shortage and the subsequent invalid XXXX late fee assessed on XXXX These charges represent proximate cause, as the escrow shortage was not due to my failure to pay but Shellpoint\'s unauthorized withdrawals, violating the Note\'s Section 5 requiring refunds of excess sums. The XXXX  notice weaponizes these errors to threaten foreclosure.\nImproper delinquency notice and foreclosure threat (1024.35(b)(11)): The XXXXXXXX  notice falsely asserts a delinquency and right to foreclose, ignoring pending NOEs and QWRs disputing the charges. This violates 1024.35(e) by failing to resolve errors before escalating, and constitutes dual tracking under 1024.41(f) by advancing foreclosure processes during loss mitigation review (triggered by your notice offering options). As the ""delinquency"" arises solely from disputed FPI, any negative action, including this abusive notice, breaches RESPA\'s protections during the 60-day dispute period (1024.35(i)) and California\'s implied covenant of good faith.\nThese errors violate RESPA, TILA Regulation Z 1026.36(c) (prompt crediting), FCRA 1681s-2(a)(3) (disputed reporting), and constitute UDAAP (deceptive practices).

On XX/XX/year> we endeavored to make a mortgage payment via phone customer service with Shellpoint of {$3300.00}. My wife gave them the bank account to withdraw the funds, they read it back to her and then gave her the confirmation number XXXX, and told us our mortgage was current. 
Over a week later my wife became concerned because the money for the payment still had not been withdrawn from our account, so she called Shellpoint again. 
On the XX/XX/XXXX call she told them the money had not been withdrawn. They retook the bank account information and gave us confirmation XXXX and told her we were current and everything was fine. 
By XX/XX/XXXX my wife noticed the money still had not been withdrawn. She gave them the bank account number again and they discovered that two of the digits in the previous withdrawal were incorrect. So, they entered the payment for a third time, again telling us we were current, the payments attempts were on file, and everything was fine with the account.

Despite telling us everything was fine and we were current three times, and despite their employee in the Customer Service Department making the error entering the account number, Shellpoint maliciously put derogatory information on our credit report as the length of time it took to resolve their error made our payments over 60 days due. This caused a dramatic drop in our credit scores which dominoed into our being denied credit because of the entry error Shellpoints employee made which we had to rectify without any aid from Shellpoint. 
I wrote Shellpoint and brought their error and subsequently filing derogatory credit information on us to their attention and received an oh, well unconcerned response. They offered no help whatsoever. 
This has left me no alternative but to file complaints to numerous agencies regarding their unfair practices. I would like the derogatory credit information removed, but short of that I would like to put this complaint on their record for malicious and unfair customer service. As I will continue to do to everyone I can find who will listen to me.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",OH,44024,None,Consent provided,Web,10/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16540235

Finally I complained to the XXXX  and got a response from their compliance dept.

My loan originated as an FHA loan through XXXX XXXX XXXX and was transferred to Shellpoint as an FHA-insured loan. During Shellpoints servicing period, the loan was converted from FHA to a Conventional product through a loan modification, without a refinance, without FHA-required procedures, After making this unauthorized loan conversion, Shellpoint then transferred the loan to XXXX XXXX , creating confusion, inaccurate loan status changes, and possible violations of FHA servicing guidelines and federal mortgage-servicing law.

These actions appear to violate : HUD Handbook 4000.1 ( FHA servicing and loss-mitigation requirements ) 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 Servicing Errors 12 C.F.R. 1024.36 Requests for Information FHA case-transfer and investor-type rules A formal complaint has also been filed with HUD for investigation into the unauthorized FHA-to-Conventional conversion and the loan transfer sequence.

I am requesting : 1. A full investigation into Shellpoints handling, modification, and

transfer of my loan. 2. All documentation showing how and why Shellpoint converted my FHA loan to Conventional. 3. All FHA case history and investor type records during Shellpoints servicing period. 4. Correction of any inaccurate or unauthorized actions taken on the loan.

12/04/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I am filing a complaint regarding Shellpoint Mortgage Servicings handling of my Deed-in-Lieu ( DIL ) request for Loan No. XXXX. Despite my full cooperation and repeated submissions of required documents, Shellpoint has failed to complete the DIL review, has given inconsistent and inaccurate explanations, and has failed to provide the information necessary for me to resolve items they claim are preventing approval.

1. I submitted a complete DIL request beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, and Shellpoint repeatedly confirmed receipt. 
Emails and letters beginning XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX show that Shellpoint requested documents, and I consistently provided them, including : Opt-Out form Borrower Assistance Form Hardship letter ServiceLink Authorization Responses to occupancy, condition, and relocation questions IRS form 4506-C Financial worksheet All of these documents were emailed to Shellpoints loss-mitigation address as instructed.

2. Shellpoint identified a single title defect in XX/XX/XXXX, and I provided proof that the lien had been paid and released. 
On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint notified me that a prior lien from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  appeared on title.

I immediately provided documentation showing the lien had been paid and released. This includes SBA correspondence and lien-release authorization ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) confirming the loan was fully satisfied and authorizing release of the lien.

Despite receiving this information, Shellpoint never confirmed whether they forwarded it to their title vendor, and they never issued an updated title determination.

3. Shellpoint later claimed my application was incomplete because of title issues, but they never told me what was still unresolved or what actions were required.

After XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint stopped communicating regarding the title issue. 
Beginning in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint again confirmed the DIL process and ordered a title report, but they did not provide any findings or request any additional documents.

At no point did Shellpoint provide a written explanation identifying any outstanding title defect.

4. Shellpoint issued a conditional DIL approval on XX/XX/XXXX, which contradicts their later claim that no complete application existed.

The conditional approval stated that I must provide clear and marketable title, but again, Shellpoint did not specify what issues remained or what was required. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted the Opt-Out form Shellpoint requested. 
This contradicts Shellpoints XX/XX/XXXX CFPB response claiming the file was incomplete and that no loss-mitigation review was pending.

5. Shellpoint continued foreclosure activity during an active DIL review.

Emails between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX show Shellpoint actively processing the DIL, collecting documentation, and issuing conditional approvals.

At the same time, Shellpoint continued foreclosure actions.

Shellpoint later claimed dual tracking did not occur, but their own documents clearly show that loss mitigation was ongoing while foreclosure continued.

6. Shellpoint has not provided the documents it claims justify denying or delaying the DIL.

In its response, Shellpoint claimed all supporting documents were included, but the following were not provided : A copy of the title report Shellpoint relied on Any documentation showing unresolved title issues Any written request for additional information after XX/XX/XXXX Any explanation for why the lien-release documents I provided were not accepted 7. Shellpoints repeated references to delinquency conflict with my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX discharge. 
Shellpoint states the communication is not an attempt to collect a debt but repeatedly states the account is due for payments. I request that Shellpoint clarify that all references are lien-based only and not personal liability, consistent with my bankruptcy discharge.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",DC,20018,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/04/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18153476

08/29/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"EMERGENCY : ILLEGAL FORECLOSURE SALE SCHEDULED XX/XX/XXXX I am filing this URGENT complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for multiple egregious federal violations regarding my mortgage loan # XXXX on my primary residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. Shellpoint has scheduled an ILLEGAL foreclosure sale for XX/XX/XXXX, despite failing to validate the debt after my timely disputes and while engaging in prohibited dual tracking. This violates the FDCPA, RESPA, California HBOR, and CFPB servicing rules, threatening immediate loss of my {>= $1,000,000} home and causing severe financial and emotional harm. 

CRITICAL VIOLATIONS : 1. FDCPA DEBT VALIDATION FAILURE ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ) I sent comprehensive debt validation demands to Shellpoint on multiple dates challenging : - Amount owed and calculation methodology - Chain of title and assignment documentation - Original creditor and current note holder identity - Shellpoint 's authority to collect/foreclose - Payment history and accounting accuracy Shellpoint FAILED to provide ANY validation within the required 30-day period under FDCPA 1692g ( b ), yet proceeded with foreclosure scheduling. This violates the mandatory cessation requirement - NO collection activity is permitted without proper validation.

2. DUAL TRACKING VIOLATIONS ( RESPA 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 & CA HBOR ) While my loss mitigation application was under review ( confirmed by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  email promising no foreclosure during evaluation ), Shellpoint simultaneously : - Recorded Notice of Default - Scheduled Notice of Trustee 's Sale for XX/XX/XXXX - Refused to halt proceedings despite pending modification review This constitutes prohibited dual tracking under RESPA 1024.41 ( f ) and California Civil Code 2923.6, demonstrating bad faith servicing.

3. IDENTITY FRAUD - WRONG BORROWER NAMES Shellpoint authorized foreclosure against "" XXXX XXXX '' and "" XXXX XXXX '' despite KNOWING our legal names are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( court-ordered name change XXXX ). This violates : - FDCPA 1692e ( false representations ) - California Rosenthal Act ( Civil Code 1788.17 ) - Elder abuse statutes ( W & I Code 15610.30 ) 4. LACK OF STANDING - SERVICER OVERREACH Shellpoint admits they are merely the servicer, with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX being the actual beneficiary. Under California law ( Glaski v. Bank of America, Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage ), servicers lack authority to foreclose without proper delegation. No such documentation provided, rendering the entire process void under Civil Code 2924. 

5. PATTERN OF CFPB NON-COMPLIANCE Previous CFPB complaints ( ID : XXXX ) show Shellpoint 's ongoing violations. Their responses demonstrate systematic non-compliance with federal servicing requirements, necessitating immediate regulatory intervention. 

IMMEDIATE HARM & IRREPARABLE INJURY : - Imminent loss of {>= $1,000,000} primary residence - Severe emotional distress and health impacts- Financial devastation from defending illegal process - Violation of fundamental due process rights- Homelessness threat to elderly borrowers SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION ATTACHED : - Cease and desist letters to all parties - Debt validation demands with proof of service - Notice of Default and Notice of Trustee 's Sale - Email from XXXX XXXX ( dual tracking evidence ) - XXXX report showing property value - Court-ordered name change documentation - Previous CFPB complaint responses- Chain of title challenges- Property deed and ownership records URGENT RELIEF REQUESTED : 1. IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION of Shellpoint 's systematic violations 2. EMERGENCY ORDER halting XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure sale 3. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE with debt validation requirements 4. SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES for ongoing federal law violations 5. RESTITUTION for damages, legal costs, and emotional harm 6. REFERRAL to DOJ/FTC for criminal investigation of elder abuse 7. SYSTEMIC REFORMS to prevent future abusive practices This represents a clear pattern of predatory servicing targeting vulnerable homeowners through systematic federal law violations.

These statements are presented on a corporate marketing page tied to XXXX XXXX XXXX of companies and used to attract borrowers, lenders, and institutional partners. 

Evidence : The attached image ( Exhibit XXXX NewRez Agency Seller/Servicer Claim ) demonstrates : Explicit public representation of agency partnerships under XXXX corporate umbrella. 
False assurance of direct agency relationships that require active compliance and financial standing certifications. 
Continued use of shared contact, branding, and disclosure formats with Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, a known XXXX-controlled subsidiary. 

Contradiction : Despite this representation, XXXX XXXX XXXX and its subsidiaries have denied operational affiliation in multiple CFPB responses, asserting wrong company. This denial conflicts directly with : 1. XXXX  own SEC filings consolidating NewRezs revenue and risk exposure ; 2. Marketing materials jointly hosted under XXXX web domain and investor presentations ; and 3. Agency registration requirements under HUD, XXXX XXXX XXXX Guides XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Guides , which require continuous disclosure of ownership and control. 

Legal Exposure : This dual representation constitutes : False Advertising under 15 U.S.C. 1125 ( a ) ( XXXX XXXX ) ; Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices under 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) ( CFPB authority ) ; Material Misrepresentation under 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5, since agency affiliations and compliance integrity directly affect risk assessment and investor valuation ; and XXXX XXXX / XXXX certification breach, as XXXX executives and counsel ( XXXX XXXX XXXX attested to accurate subsidiary disclosure in SEC filings XXXX 

Interpretation : NewRezs public advertising of XXXX-backed agency partnerships, while XXXX simultaneously disclaims affiliation before regulators, evidences intentional misdirection of investors, borrowers, and federal agencies. 
This pattern reflects systemic deception within XXXX corporate governance and qualifies as a XXXX oversight failure, extending personal liability to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX NewRez ) XXXX XXXX ( certifying counsel on the S-3 registration ) Requested Enforcement Action : 1. Refer to CFPB Enforcement and SEC XXXX XXXX XXXX for joint review under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
2. Demand corrective disclosures identifying NewRez and Shellpoint as fully owned and controlled entities under XXXX XXXX. 
3. Open investigation into federal contractor and agency certification integrity regarding XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX seller/servicer designations. 
False SEC Disclosure and XXXX Misrepresentation XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a Form S-3 registration statement certified by XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and accurate disclosure of its subsidiaries and material risks. Despite that certification, XXXX continues to conceal its operational ownership of NewRez LLC and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, entities that publicly engage in federally regulated servicing. These subsidiaries have simultaneously claimed wrong company in CFPB filingsdirectly contradicting XXXX consolidated financial statements and agency marketing materials. 

This duality establishes : 1. Material omission of affiliated risk in violation of Rule XXXX ; 2. False Sarbanes-Oxley certification ( SOX 302 / 404 ) ; 3.

Potential aiding and abetting liability for XXXX XXXX under 17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5 ( c ) and 18 U.S.C. 2, given that its certification enabled the filings distribution to investors. 

Accordingly, regulators should reopen XXXX S-3 registration for enforcement review and require amended disclosures identifying NewRez and Shellpoint as direct subsidiaries under XXXX governance chain.

10/20/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am a senior citizen, XXXX XXXX, facing ongoing violations of my rights by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing regarding my mortgage on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( Account # XXXX ). Due to my age and health, I rely on an advocate to assist me, and I have provided written authorization for them to act on my behalf. The entire call with Shellpoint on XX/XX/year>, was recorded, and my advocate requested a postponement of the foreclosure sale date, but Shellpoint provided no response except that someone would call me backyet no call has been received.

This follows a pattern of misconduct documented in recent correspondence ( e.g., emails from XXXX XXXX XXXX, counsel for Shellpoint, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Shellpoint has refused to communicate directly with me or my advocate, citing pending litigation ( XXXX XXXX XXXX Case No. XXXX, filed XX/XX/year> ), which violates my rights under RESPA ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ). My advocate submitted a complete loss mitigation package, acknowledged by Shellpoint, yet they refuse to process it or provide a decision within the required 30 days.

Worse, Shellpoints attorney previously stated in writing that no further modifications are possible because Ive exceeded three attempts, claiming this aligns with FHA financing limits. However, I have a conventional loan, not FHA, and there are no such limits under federal or California law ( HBOR 2923.6 ). This misrepresentation is deceptive and has delayed my ability to appeal or resolve the matter. The property has significant equity ( {$4.00} XXXX value, {$3.00} XXXX available to creditors ), and Shellpoint faces no financial risk from a delay, yet they persist with a vague two-week postponement of the XX/XX/year>, sale date instead of the 30 days I requested.

Additional violations include : Unresponsive QWRs : My Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) submitted XX/XX/year>, and multiple follow-ups remain unanswered, exceeding RESPAs 30-day response period ( 12 CFR 1024.36 ).

Dual Tracking : Despite a complete modification package confirmed by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/year> ) and Shellpoints XX/XX/year> acknowledgment, the sale proceeds, violating RESPA 1024.41 ( g ) and HBOR 2923.6 ( c ).

Notice Failures : I was never mailed a denial notice, breaching RESPA ( 1024.36 ) and HBOR ( 2923.6 ) obligations.

Discriminatory Conduct : As a senior, my reliance on an advocate should not be used to deny me due process, potentially violating fair lending laws.

I dispute the debt ( {>= $1,000,000} + {$190000.00} arrears ), asserting it should be approximately {$700000.00} or {$0.00} based on 18 years of payments and Shellpoints questionable standing, as raised in my lawsuit.

11/13/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,Loan sold or transferred to another company,"XXXX. Summary of Complaint On XX/XX/year>, the servicing of my home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) was transferred from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( New Rez ) to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX On that same day, I made my regular mortgage payment of {$1000.00} to Shellpoint. Shellpoint has failed to properly apply or forward this payment, causing XXXX  to incorrectly report my account as delinquent. Despite my efforts to resolve this, I have been threatened with foreclosure and forced to make XXXX months of payments in XXXX months to protect my credit and home, causing significant financial strain. 

XXXX. Detailed Chronology of Events XX/XX/year> : My HELOC servicing was officially transferred from Shellpoint to XXXX. I made my scheduled payment of {$1000.00} to Shellpoint, believing it to be the correct payee as the transfer was effective that day. 
XXXX XX/XX/year> : I received a notice from XXXX stating my account was delinquent. I was confused, as I had made the XXXX payment. 
XXXX 2025 : The situation escalated when XXXX sent me correspondence regarding a potential foreclosure on my property. To avoid this severe action, I felt compelled to pay XXXX for both XXXX and XXXX, plus associated late fees, despite having already paid XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX contacted me again, stating I was now delinquent for the XXXX payment. This ongoing cycle of delinquency is a direct result of the unresolved XXXX payment. 
XX/XX/year> : To stop the continued delinquency notices and further threats to my home, I was forced to make another double payment to XXXX, covering both XXXX and XXXX. In just over XXXX months with the new servicer, I have made XXXX payments due to an error that is not my own. 

XXXX. Attempts to Resolve the Issue I have made extensive efforts to contact Shellpoint to resolve the missing XXXX payment : I have attempted to call Shellpoint over XXXX times. Each time, the automated system requires an active account number to proceed. Since my account was transferred, I no longer have an active number, and I am unable to speak to a live representative. The calls are systematically terminated. 
On XX/XX/year>, I used my still-accessible online portal with Shellpoint to send a secure email requesting information and a resolution. To date, I have received no response. 

My attempts to inform XXXX of the payment made to Shellpoint have not resolved the core issue, as they insist the payment was never received or applied. 

XXXX. Specific Harm and Relief Requested Due to the errors and failures of both Shellpoint and XXXX I have suffered : Financial Harm : I have been forced to pay {$2100.00} ahead of schedule ( for XXXX and XXXX ) to avoid foreclosure. 
Unjust Fees : I have been charged late fees for payments I actually made on time.

Desired Resolution : Immediate correction of the principal balance and a certified, written statement confirming the correction.

Detailed Complaint Summary : Material Servicing Error This complaint concerns an egregious and material error in the principal balance communicated by the new mortgage servicer, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, following the transfer of my loan. 

1. Servicing Transfer Details : XX/XX/year> Original Lender/Servicer : XXXX  XXXX XXXX New Servicer ( Company Complained Against ) : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Effective Date of Transfer : XX/XX/year> Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA Account Number : XXXX 2. Factual Error : The actual, verifiable Principal Balance owed on the mortgage loan at the time of transfer was {>= $1,000,000}. 

However, the initial servicing paperwork, including the Welcome Packet/Transfer Statement ], incorrectly states the Principal Balance owed as {>= $1,000,000}. This amount is precisely ten times the correct, legally-owed principal balance.

3. Prior Attempted Resolution : I contacted Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing regarding this error on XX/XX/year>. The representative acknowledged the error and stated that a correction would be processed. No corrected statement or written confirmation of the correction has been received. 

4. Impact and Violation : This is not a minor clerical error ; it is a ten-fold exaggeration of the debt, directly impacting the accuracy of all subsequent statements, escrow calculations, and future payoff quotes. 

The servicer 's failure to onboard the loan with the correct material balance constitutes a failure to maintain accurate and timely information and is a violation of federal mortgage servicing requirements, specifically those related to error resolution and information accuracy under Regulation ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ). The error is sufficiently large to indicate a severe systemic failure in the loan transfer process. 

5. Demand : I request the CFPB immediately forward this Notice of Error to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and demand the following : Immediate correction of the Principal Balance to the correct amount of {>= $1,000,000}. 

Written confirmation ( via mail or secure portal ) of the correction, including a copy of an accurate, corrected servicing statement, and confirmation that all internal systems have been updated.

Unified Forensic Accounting, XXXX XXXX, and Systemic Misconduct Report XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( a XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) I. Executive Introduction This forensic dossier establishes, through authenticated metadata, payment ledgers, call recordings, and amortization reconstruction, a sustained and system-wide pattern of payment misapplication, document falsification, and coercive foreclosure conduct by NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, wholly owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, NewRez repeatedly : 1. Accepted full, timely payments yet placed them in unapplied/suspense status. 
2. Generated retroactively dated statements showing artificial delinquencies.

3. Issued batch-produced foreclosure threats to current borrowers.

4. Misrepresented balances to investors and credit bureaus.

Enhanced digital forensicsvia optical character recognition ( OCR ), XXXX hashing, and XXXX XXXX XXXX  that document creation timestamps, internal software tags, and revision histories were overwritten or erased, confirming manual alteration. These findings align with federal class-action evidence ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX v. NewRez, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). 



XXXX. Loan Parameters and Evidentiary Source Validation Original Principal : {$620.00} XXXX Rate : 5.25 % ( fixed ) Term : 30 years ( 360 months ) Monthly Payment ( XXXX ) : {$3.00} XXXX Portion : $ XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX Current Principal ( XX/XX/XXXX ) : {$580.00} XXXX All statements, letters, and portal screenshots were authenticated through enhanced OCR and XXXX hashing. Header data identify generation by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Timestamp sequences are non-chronological : multiple XX/XX/XXXX PDFs carry XX/XX/XXXX creation datesconclusive evidence of retroactive document regeneration. Identical anomalies appear in XXXX exhibits from XXXX and XXXX. 

Amortization Comparison ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) Period Expected Principal ( 5.25 % ) Actual Principal ( NewRez XXXX ) Variance Observations XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$10.00} XXXX {$8.00} XXXX {$2.00} XXXX XXXX payments posted late ; escrow overdrawn XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$11.00} XXXX {$10.00} XXXX {$1.00} 805 Months flagged partial though paid in full XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$10.00} XXXX {$9.00} XXXX {$1.00} XXXX Multiple unapplied entries ; suspense activity XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$1.00} XXXX {$960.00} {$770.00} XX/XX/XXXX payment ( {$3.00} XXXX ) not applied Totals {$35.00} XXXX {$31.00} XXXX {$4.00} XXXX Aggregate uncredited principal reduction Interpretation : Had payments been properly credited, the principal should equal {$580.00} XXXX. NewRezs figure ( {$580.00} XXXX ) inflates principal by {$4.00} XXXX, compounding {$1.00} XXXX in unwarranted interestnumerically consistent with the {$16.00} XXXX unapplied balance the company acknowledged in recorded calls. 



XXXX. Forensic Accounting Reconstruction ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) Total Payments : {$140.00} XXXX Funds : {$16.00} XXXX ( acknowledged XX/XX/XXXX ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX payments ( {$750.00} and {$3.00} XXXX ) cleared the XXXX checking account. Shellpoints portal displayed Last Payment Received XX/XX/XXXX yet credited only {$750.00}. Bank records and metadata logs prove both withdrawals succeededan internal misapplication. The remaining {$3.00} XXXX discrepancy equals the uncredited portion of the larger transfer. 

During that call, the agent confirmed {$12.00} XXXX held unapplied, promised to apply it toward XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and issue a {$4.00} XXXX refund check within XXXX business days. No correction occurred. 

Despite full payment, on XX/XX/XXXX NewRez issued a foreclosure-threat letter demanding {$14.00} XXXX fabricated arrearage. This violates RESPA 6, Reg X 1024.35, and FDCPA 807 ( 10 ). 



IV. XXXX Integrity Findings Enhanced OCR & XXXX XXXX Results Overwritten transaction nodes : XMP fields re-saved post-issuance. 
Batch foreclosure templates : identical XXXX hashes and creation timestamps across letters. 
Erased edit trails : missing Modified-By fields indicate intentional scrubbing. 
Cross-file correlation : metadata rewrite dates match accounting anomalies. 

These signatures expose a centralized document pipeline used to mass-produce foreclosure demands while suspending fundsconfirming systemic intent, not clerical error. 

XI. Evidentiary Recordings and Witness Testimony ( Expanded ) A. Categories of Recorded Evidence 1. Acknowledgment and Promise of Correction ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ) Agents confirmed {$12.00} XXXX held in unapplied funds, promised application to XXXX XXXX and a {$4.00} XXXX refund. 
Legal significance : Establishes actual knowledge of funds, promise of restitution, and subsequent breach. 
XXXX. Contradictory Balances and Mathematical Manipulation ( Multiple XXXX ) Several calls show agents producing impossible arithmeticfor example, stating that paying {$3.00} XXXX left the borrower two months behind, or recalculating arrears differently within a single conversation. 
Legal significance : Demonstrates deceptive accounting practices ; violates RESPA XXXX ( k ) ( XXXX ) ( A ) ( failure to apply payments ) and FDCPA XXXX ( XXXX ) ( A ) ( false representation of debt ). 
XXXX. Refusal to Provide Audit or Accounting Transparency ( XXXX ) Borrower requested a full audit under Reg X 1024.35 ; agents repeatedly stated : We can only send you a payment history ; we dont provide audits.

Despite formal Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ), no reconciliation was furnished.

Legal significance : Each refusal constitutes a discrete servicing-error violation under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ) and establishes a pattern or practice of non-compliance.

4. Contradictory Status Updates and Foreclosure Threats ( XXXX ) On calls where the borrower was told youre current, subsequent letters and emails within days claimed three months delinquent.

Legal significance : Evidence of systemic miscommunication between servicing and collections systems ; supports unfair-practice claim under CFPA 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

5. Coercive Catch-Up Payment Demands ( 20232025 ) Agents pressured the borrower to make back-dated payments to stay in good standing, even while unapplied balances existed sufficient to cover future installments.

Legal significance : Coercive collection tacticactionable under FDCPA 807 ( 10 ) and RESPA 6 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( A ) for damages stemming from unnecessary duplicate payments. 


Recorded Admissions ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ) During a 15-minute call with a NewRez servicing agent, later authenticated and time-stamped, the agent expressly confirmed : I see about XXXX XXXX dollars in unapplied funds on your account. Well go ahead and move that to XXXX and XXXX payments and issue you a refund check for around XXXX XXXX dollars. You should receive that within seven to ten business days. 

A follow-up call the next morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) with a different agent corroborated the same data and timeframe. 
Neither agent disputed that all payments were current. 
These conversations, preserved in unedited .wav format and verified via hash, prove actual knowledge of unapplied funds and a clear promise of correction that was never fulfilled. 

Despite those admissions, a foreclosure threat letter dated XX/XX/XXXX demanded {$14.00} XXXX to reinstate the loan. 
Issuing a collection or foreclosure notice after explicit internal acknowledgment of a current account constitutes : a knowing misrepresentation of debt under FDCPA XXXX ( XXXX ) ; a failure to correct a servicing error under RESPA XXXX / Reg X XXXX ; and evidence of reckless disregard supporting punitive damages under RESPA XXXX ( f ) ( XXXX ) ( B ). 

These calls, combined with metadata and ledger data, shift this case from administrative negligence to deliberate misconduct. 


V. Batch Foreclosure Workflow and Systemic Pattern Metadata from the XX/XX/XXXX foreclosure notices shows identical workstation ID and creation window, establishing batch mail merging across borrowers. 
This pattern mirrors nationwide litigation : XXXX v. NewRez LLC, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX class action alleging zombie reinstatement balances. 
XXXX v. NewRez LLC, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX RESPA/FDCPA violations. 
XXXX v. NewRez LLC, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX escrow and payment misapplication. 

The CFPB XXXX Highlights XXXX XXXX and FTC Mortgage Servicing Advisory XXXX both reference NewRez-related audits on suspense-account practices and automated foreclosure generation. Public court filings confirm ongoing multistate Attorney General investigations into XXXX XXXX servicing arm.

XXXX XXXX Washington XXXX DC XXXX Subject : Complaint Regarding Incorrect Mortgage Maturity Date Reported by Servicer Dear Sir or Madam, I am submitting this complaint regarding Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, a division of Newrez Mortgage, for reporting and maintaining incorrect information in my mortgage account statements. 
Description of the Issue My mortgage account statements currently reflect a maturity date of XX/XX/XXXX. The correct maturity date, as established in my loan documents, is XX/XX/XXXX. 
This error arose after my loan servicing was transferred to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to that, my loan was serviced by XXXX Mortgage XXXX, also part of Newrez Mortgage. Statements issued by XXXX reflected the correct maturity date. 
Supporting Documentation I have retained and can provide : Multiple monthly account statements from XXXX Mortgage XXXX, all reflecting the correct maturity date. 
A Modification Agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX, which explicitly establishes the maturity date as XX/XX/XXXX. 
There have been no subsequent modifications or agreements that would alter this date. 
Attempts to Resolve with Servicer On XX/XX/XXXX, during a three-way call with a third party ( related to an outside transaction requiring proof of the correct maturity date ), Shellpoint representatives XXXX that he must submit a written request by email to have the matter reviewed. That request was submitted by email on XX/XX/XXXX. And that email can not be from the customer because it will not be answered ; that needs to be for a XXXX party only On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Shellpoint again to follow up. I was informed that : It would take XXXX business days merely to receive confirmation that my request was acknowledged. 
After acknowledgment, it would take another XXXX business days to determine whether the error would be corrected. 
The department handling such matters does not provide a direct telephone number for consumers. 
During that call, I spoke with a XXXX identifying himself as Pick. He stated that the incorrect maturity date does not affect my mortgage and further advised that his supervisor does not accept calls from consumers. He claimed that a request would be sent to his supervisor and that I would receive a callback. I specifically asked for the callback to occur before XXXX XXXX. Now at this moment XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX am EST, I havent received a phone call from Shellpoint XXXX. 
Impact of the Error This incorrect maturity date has caused significant delays in a separate financial transaction I am attempting to complete with a third party, who requires accurate account statements from my mortgage servicer. The continued reporting of an incorrect maturity date prevents me from moving forward with that transaction and creates unnecessary hardship. 
Requested XXXX I respectfully request that : XXXX. Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing immediately corrects the maturity date in the account statements ; the correct date shows in their system in the account details to reflect the accurate date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX. Updated account statements be issued showing the correct maturity date. 
XXXX. The CFPB ensures Shellpoint provides accurate information to me as a borrower, and that its escalation and complaint-handling process be reviewed for compliance with consumer protection standards. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The funds cleared the Federal Reserve ACH network and were posted to NewRezs operating account the same day ( Exhibit B-8 ).

However, Shellpoints borrower portal and payment history omit this transaction entirely.

This establishes that NewRez accepted funds, failed to credit them, and then falsified borrower-visible balancesa direct breach of TILA, RESPA, and Dodd-Frank UDAAP standards .

II. Forensic Cross-Verification Source Date Amount Unique Identifier XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Statement XX/XX/XXXX {$5000.00} debit XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Funds left borrower account NewRez receiving account confirmed Shellpoint Portal Ledger XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Portal Payment History No {$5000.00} entry shown Ledger reflects Total Payments {$5000.00} instead, fabricated aggregate Principal Balance Trend XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX trace No principal reduction despite ACH credit proves non-application XXXX confirmation : Screenshots share identical XXXX XXXX resolution and orientation hash ( XXXX ) temporal continuity verified. 



III. Regulatory Violations 1. 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( i ) Failure to credit payment as of date received.

Each uncredited payment constitutes a distinct violation ; see CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
2. 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ) ( 3 ) ( i ) Failure to maintain accurate records.

Servicer maintained parallel internal and borrower-facing ledgers.

3. 12 U.S.C. 5531 & 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) Unfair and deceptive acts and practices ( UDAAP ). 
Concealing applied funds to create delinquency satisfies the statutory definition of deceptive. 
4. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Furnishing false credit information.

False delinquency from this missing credit damages the borrowers credit profile.

5. 18 U.S.C. 1005 False entries in bank records ( potential criminal exposure ).

IV. Forensic Interpretation The XXXX XXXX XXXX matches the same NewRez receiving gateway used for prior mortgage debits.

Ledger absence of that amount while the principal balance remains static is mathematically impossible under XXXX XXXX XXXX unless the funds were diverted to a suspense or off-ledger account. 
The discrepancy surfaced within XXXX hours of your XX/XX/XXXX portal recalculation eventconsistent with intentional data overwriting. 



V. Aggregate Impact Adding this verified payment raises the total unapplied/misapplied balance to {$100000.00} {$110000.00}. 
At XXXX  % interest, accrued overcharges exceed {$5700.00} per year. 
Resulting harm includes : Ongoing false delinquency and credit suppression ; Emotional and psychological distress from unjust foreclosure threats ; Loss of use of trapped funds ; Systemic risk if similar ledger re-codings exist across NewRezs portfolio.

VI. Requested Regulatory Action 1. Immediate CFPB and XXXX joint audit of NewRez/Shellpoint ledger and ACH reconciliation systems. 
XXXX. Mandated ledger correction : credit {$5000.00} to principal with interest from XX/XX/XXXX. 
3. Restitution : reimburse {$100000.00} total misapplied funds + interest + fee refunds.

4. Credit repair : issue corrective data to all CRAs under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ).

5. Referral to DOJ Consumer Protection Branch for potential false entry prosecution ( 18 U.S.C. 1005 ).

VII. Conclusion This {$5000.00} ACH transaction provides irrefutable proof that NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing deliberately manipulated account data to erase applied funds and manufacture delinquency. 
The bank-verified evidence, metadata-authenticated screenshots, and consistent re-coding pattern satisfy the legal threshold for knowing and willful misconduct under federal consumer-finance law.

10/22/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","My mortgage was sold by CMC Funding to New Rez in XX/XX/XXXX. It has been totally mismanaged from day 1. The customer service representatives including managers though for the most part pleasant have been a wealth of misinformation which has caused me financial harm. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, right before the sale I received a letter from CMC Funding showing I had an escrow shortage and my mortgage payment was increasing from {$1400.00} to {$1400.00}. I started receiving statements from New Rez in XXXX, my payment did not increase from XXXX through XXXX remaining at {$1400.00}. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from New Rez and a check of {$1600.00} for an escrow excess. I did not cash this check as it made no sense since I was told in XXXX I had a shortage. In XXXX I received my statement and my payment had decreased by {$500.00} to {$900.00} and stayed that way till XX/XX/XXXX. I call about the check I was still holding onto and the decrease in my mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and was told by the rep it was an escrow excess and I could cash it. This made zero sense to me. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a XXXX who told me to cash the check and pay it back to the escrow from what she could see it looked like a missed tax payment at one point. She would request an escrow analysis and by XXXX and XXXX payments should work themselves out. 
XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a XXXX who told me the escrow was now short {$2000.00}. I paid back the check for {$160.00} plus an additional {$380.00} to clear the shortage. She was going to reach out to the city to make sure the taxes are being paid correctly. 
XX/XX/XXXX. My mortgage payments are now {$1000.00} after the payments and the new analysis. Why??? They should be around {$1400.00}! Per New Rez rep I spoke with the escrow balance transferred was a surplus form the other company. Payments will stay at this amount until the new escrow analysis in XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX New escrow analysis not shows I have an escrow shortage of {$4400.00}. Mortgage payment will increase {$410.00} each month to {$1400.00}. Rep I spoke with said we can do another analysis but this appears correct. I spoke with a manager who said the same thing and was insisting my property taxes increased by $ XXXX.. I explained they absolutely did not and asked for proof before they did redo the analysis. In further discussion they said your taxes are {$7900.00}. I confirmed that as correct. She did a little more digging and said somehow they had y taxes as {$3900.00} which is why my mortgage payments were dropped.The payment was based on incorrect projected taxes, basically half of what I pay in taxes. This was a huge error on their part. She said I could pay all or a portion of the escrow shortage to reduce my payment. 
XX/XX/XXXX Because I was so shocked by all of this I called back and spoke with XXXX who went over everything in detail. She was supposed to email me all the escrow analysises done on my account since summer XXXX but never did. She did confirm from what she was that during the transition New Rez somehow used had the years taxes to project my payments. 
XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with XXXX went over my mismanaged mortgage again and I agreed to pay {$3000.00} toward the escrow shortage as I didn't have the full {$4400.00}. He put in a request for an escrow analysis that will be completed in 5 days. He said this will determine how the additional {$1400.00} shortage will be added to my mortgage. So it was confirmed again that my payments were based on taxes of {$3900.00} and this year taxes are based on {$790000.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX Spoke with someone about new escrow analysis based on the XXXX I paid. They said it's being done now and to call early next week for your new payment. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called to check on the escrow. The woman I spoke with said your payment is not changing. Unless you pay the full shortage they do not do another escrow analysis.I said then what was the point of me giving you {$3000.00} if nothing is changing.What are you doing with that money? I asked for her to refund me the money since it is better sitting in my bank account than at NewRez. She confirmed that my payment would stay at {$1400.00}. This did not sit well with me so I called back to speak with a different representative in the afternoon who told me yes they do reconfigure your payment if you do a partial payment. I told her I was just told otherwise then the phone was disconnected. I called back and spoke with a different rep, XXXX who told me we do not redo the analysis for a partial payment and confirmed my payment is unchanged and that they are refunding my money. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called again and spoke with a rep who told me it's up to the escrow department when they receive the payment if they choose to redo the analysis. This makes zero sense. 
There is not an opportunity to speak with the escrow department or anyone in charge that has institutional knowledge. The mismanagement of my loan has been horrendous. I feel they owe me at the very least a reevaluation of my escrow with the payment after royally screwing up my payments for a year. The barriers they put up to speak with anyone other than the basic rep are ridiculous. I have asked for emails of our conversation or copies of analysises done and have never received anything.

12/03/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"Consumer : XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY XXXX Phone : XXXX Email : XXXX Servicer : Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing / NewRez LLC Loan # : XXXX Property : Primary residence 1. Summary of the Complaint Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing/NewRez is attempting to collect, enforce, and foreclose on a mortgage without legal standing, without a valid chain of title, and without proof that the alleged creditor ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX ) has any lawful ownership interest in my loan. 

Shellpoint has never provided evidence of ownership or authority, and XXXX XXXX XXXX records show that the alleged creditor was stricken in XXXX and never reinstated. Foreclosure is being pursued anyway. 



2. Core Issues A. No Valid Chain of Title Exists Shellpoint claims the loan is owned by : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

However : 1. There is no recorded assignment into XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
2. The only assignment recorded in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was defective AND the plaintiff was stricken by the court. 
3. No chain of title exists between Decision One ( original lender ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
4. No assignment exists to Shellpoint or NewRez. 

Shellpoint refuses to provide any documentation proving ownership or standing. 



B. The Trust Can not Legally Own the Loan According to trust law and the XXXX : XXXX XXXX closed in XXXX. 
The cut-off date prohibits any post-closing assignments. 
New York law ( XXXX XXXXXXXX ) makes late transfers void, not voidable. 
County records show an XXXX entry added years later ( XXXX ) long after trust closing. 

This makes any claim of XXXX ownership null and void. 

Shellpoint ignored this in prior responses. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX Uploaded Clerk Minutes ( XXXX ) show : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX STRICKEN Alternative Loan Trust XXXX STRICKEN No standing was ever restored. 

Shellpoint continues to represent XXXX XXXX as the creditor despite the courts ruling. 



D. Shellpoint Refuses to Provide the Note, XXXX, or XXXX XXXX Shellpoint has not produced : An endorsed promissory note A valid allonge Custody certifications Investor transfer records Servicing authority documentation Boarding records Without the note and chain of custody, foreclosure enforcement is unlawful. 



E. Foreclosure Was Referred Without Proven Standing Shellpoint states : The account has been referred to foreclosure. 

Yet : There is no recorded assignment into XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX was legally stricken as plaintiff. 
Shellpoint can not foreclose as a servicer without a valid creditor. 

This violates New York standing laws, RESPA, FDCPA, and UDAAP protections. 



F. Escrow Fraud / Manufactured Shortages Multiple escrow statements show : Negative escrow balance of {$62000.00} No tax or insurance disbursements Shortage amounts increasing without explanation Payment increases to {$5100.00} and {$4600.00} with no valid basis Shellpoint collecting large escrow amounts for items never paid This appears to be : Escrow miscalculation Servicing manipulation Creation of artificial default UDAAP violation under 12 USC 5531 Shellpoint did not address or justify these discrepancies.

3. Laws and Regulations Potentially Violated RESPA / Regulation X ( 12 CFR 1024.35, 1024.36, 1024.41 ) Failure to respond to information requests Dual tracking Failure to provide ownership documentation Failure to investigate servicing errors FDCPA / UDAAP Misrepresenting the identity of the creditor Collecting payments without legal authority Threatening foreclosure without standing Escrow manipulation New York Foreclosure Law ( XXXX XXXX & XXXX ) Plaintiff must have standing BEFORE initiating foreclosure Assignments must be recorded PRIOR to enforcement New York XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Transfers into a trust after the cut-off date are void 4. Requested CFPB Action I request that CFPB require Shellpoint to provide : 1. Full chain of title ( XXXX ) 2. Recorded assignment proving XXXX ownership 3. Endorsed promissory note and allonge 4. Custodial and transfer history showing the note ever reached the trust 5. Servicing authority documents ( boarding records, servicing transfers, investor direction ) 6. Explanation for XXXX XXXX being stricken 7. Explanation for the XXXX XXXX filing 8. Explanation for severe escrow manipulation 9. Immediate halt of foreclosure activity until standing is established 5. Consumer Harm Because Shellpoint refuses to prove ownership or standing : I am being threatened with wrongful foreclosure.

Escrow shortages and inflated payments have caused financial harm.

Shellpoint is attempting to collect on a mortgage without proving legal authority.

I am enduring severe stress and risk of losing my primary residence unlawfully.

08/28/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"An existing modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or other loss mitigation relief","I am writing to you to request more clarification on the following actions of your company with respects to my loan, following XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The following is a timeline of events with my questions for clarification in red. 
( XXXX ) XXXX declared disaster on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I called to make the payment due XX/XX/XXXX and to ask what my options were for mortgage relief after a disaster. I was told because I was in a XXXX declared disaster zone, I can have 90 days forbearance, with no documentation required. Therefore, I proceeded to NOT make payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX due to the disaster forbearance plan that I was told by your representative that I will be placed in. Based on the information given, I was on disaster forbearance and my next payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. 
- I called again sometime in XXXX to find out the options after forbearance and the consequences of entering in a disaster forbearance program. I was told that I would need to pay the delinquent amount back in full after the forbearance. The representative was rude, short and dismissive. I was provided with confusing information and told there is no such thing as deferring payments and not paying interest. According to the CFPB, this violates servicing rules by keeping borrowers in the dark about critical information about the process of applying for foreclosure relief. The representatives that I talked to in XXXX were not educated on the current policies for servicing a loan following a disaster. 
( XXXX ) According to Shellpoint documentation, it is confirmed that I called on XX/XX/XXXX to request disaster forbearance but it was indicated by my current point of contact, XXXX XXXX, that I was not actually documented as being in disaster forbearance. This was told to me in XXXX. So my question is when it came time for this initial 90 day forbearance to end, was I documented as just delinquent for no XXXX declared event? Was XXXX XXXX notified that the reason for my delinquency was a disaster? Is it required for XXXX XXXX to be notified that I am in disaster forbearance? How did that affect the fees for property preservation? How did that affect the timeline of foreclosure? Did that affect the manner in which it was communicated to the credit bureaus for the reason of my delinquency? 
( XXXX ) In XX/XX/XXXX, before the initial disaster forbearance ended, I called Shellpoint and was given a loss mitigation point of contact, XXXX XXXX. I explained that I was displaced following the disaster and requested another 90 day extension of disaster forbearance. This representative listened to my hardship concerns caused by the disaster and said she will put me on a disaster forbearance plan for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( my POC ), who was very empathetic during the conversation, stated that I would not have to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX because of disaster forbearance! She said that in the most empathetic and understanding way. I am so certain of this that would like you to listen to the recording of the XXXX call. I used the information she provided me to plan and budget for resuming normal payments. And in reality, XX/XX/XXXX was NOT the first day I owed, it was the first day of Foreclosure. She never explained the plan or plans that would result in paying XX/XX/XXXX. I thought I had just received an extension of the first 3 months, resulting in a total of 6 months in disaster forbearance. At this time I was not educated on the possibility of a disaster deferral plan even though I inquired about the consequences of being in a disaster forbearance ( asking how it could affect interest, laid fees, credit reporting, foreclosure? ) I was not explained the XXXX possible solutions on the hierarchy for post forbearance so that I could make plans to choose which is best. 
-After that phone call, I received a letter, dating XX/XX/XXXX, that I was behind on my mortgage by XXXX payments ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and had been reported to the credit bureaus. Based on my conversation with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), I thought this was a normal part of the disaster forbearance process. The letter from XX/XX/XXXX did not mention anything about those months being a disaster related forbearance, but seemed like just a delinquency for a non disaster issue. It was simply to let me know that I was delinquent, which I thought was satisfactory since I was in a XXXX declared disaster area and was assured by XXXX XXXX that I am in disaster forbearance. 
I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that also appeared in my loss mitigation documents portal. So this is where I assumed that all loss mitigation offers would be sent. It stated that I owed {$0.00} for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX due to a disaster forbearance plan. I was making plans to resume payments on XXXX. XXXX. I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, just to be sure that I paid before the end of the 6 months forbearance- which I thought would be the XX/XX/XXXX payment following my forbearance period. Because I did not realize that I was not in disaster forbearance for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, I thought this was my payment for XX/XX/XXXX. But I believe it was applied to XX/XX/XXXX ( my most delinquent month ). 
More specific correspondence to properly educate me on the options may have been sent by usps, but not through email or the e-mailbox on the platform. All important notifications were either in my e- mailbox or my loss mitigation documents on the portal. Why are some documents mailed while others are sent through regular mail and e- mailbox on the portal? Why was I not educated on the disaster deferral program? This should have been included in the available documents on my loss mitigation portal. I indicated to XXXX XXXX that I was displaced after the storm and to please send notifications and offers to the portal. She agreed. 
XXXX XXXX, I got an email, however no correspondence on my electronic mailbox on the platform, saying that my forbearance is ending. It is time to start planning for end of forbearance options, click this video, that did not work, but I thought I had planned for that and already made that payment that was to be due XXXX. XXXX. I was planning to make another one on XX/XX/XXXX, and be back on track with my regular monthly payment. I was not solicited for a disaster deferral, I knew that I could not repay the default in full, but I was confused on what my options were because the correspondence was really vague and never defined the disaster deferral program or how to enter it. Was I solicited for the disaster deferral program, only through usps? Should it be required that they also send that to the mortgage servicer e-mailbox? How was I solicited for it and educated about the plan? 
According to the servicing XXXX XXXX loans during a disaster, The Servicer must evaluate the Borrower for a proactive offer for a Disaster Payment Deferral in accordance with the eligibility criteria described below. If eligible, the Servicer must send the Borrower a proactive offer for a Disaster Payment Deferral by the XXXX day following expiration of the forbearance plan. You do not have to prove or document anything to Shellpoint to be solicited for a disaster deferral program when you are exiting disaster forbearance. 
The disaster deferral plan should have been solicited to me with the same accessibility as the streamlined modification and BEFORE I was solicited for the streamlined modification, as that causes great confusion. These are deceiving acts to prevent me from choosing the plan that is best for me. 
Before XX/XX/XXXX, I should have been approved and offered a disaster deferral program, the preferred program for my status. On XX/XX/XXXX I received, a solicitation letter, made available on my loss mitigation documents portal and through usps, offering me the streamlined loan modification plan, indicating that I needed to make a modified payment in my trial plan on XX/XX/XXXX. When I was solicited for the streamlined modification plan, I was not sent the solicitation letter that was adapted for post disaster forbearance. 
This offer should have been sent after the disaster deferral agreement ended or if I declined. According to the hierarchy from XXXX XXXX, I should have been solicited for the XXXX XXXX XXXX modification after the disaster deferral offer expired. Why was the streamline load modification solicited to me at this time? 
Was I solicited for the streamlined loan modification plan at that time because at the end of my official disaster forbearance ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ), I was more than 60 days delinquent due to not being properly documented for disaster forbearance in XXXX XXXX and XXXX To be solicited for disaster deferral you must have been less than 60 days current at the time of the disaster. 
Was I solicited for a disaster deferral plan? Was this mailed to me? Because I am displaced, is it required to have it uploaded on my loss mitigation portal? Why was the streamline loan modification agreement more readily available for me to view on the portal? I have requested a copy of the solicitation/offer for the disaster deferral options but was told by my XXXX XXXX XXXX that I did NOT qualify, based on insufficient information and thus no solicitation was EVER offered for the disaster payment deferral. I would like to confirm that I was proactively solicitated for the disaster deferral program and not just the streamlined modification plan. This should have been done on or before XX/XX/XXXX. Instead on or before XX/XX/XXXX, I was solicited for a streamlined modification by usps and the electronic mailbox. 
I have made the XXXX trial payments for the modified loan and they are currently sending me a loan modification agreement with a total principal balance of a much higher number due to about {$4000.00} interest.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,32751,None,Consent provided,Web,08/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15590297
09/09/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"The company that bought our loan after we purchased the home was Shellpoint/New Rez. We financed our home at XXXX. Around XXXX of XXXX my husband was laid off. Forcing us to file for unemployment and food stamps, and needing to enter a loan forbearance program to get by. The forbearance program ended in XXXX and our first payment was due in XXXX. We were originally told to make regular monthly payments while we figured out and decided on what program we would go into once the forbearance was over. Shellpoint would not allow us to make a regular payment, they wanted a single payment of around XXXX and refused to allow us to pay any less than that. It was that or nothing. We first agreed to a repayment plan. The representative was not completing their end of the paperwork, so they would not accept payment from us. I called frequently from XXXX of XXXX checking to see if their paperwork was complete so we could make a payment as we were ready to make a payment and tried to make a payment in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Finally after escalating the issue and demanding to have a different representative on our case, they complied but told us because of their representative not doing their paperwork we now no longer qualified for a repayment plan and we're told we would have to enter a loan modification program, otherwise they would foreclose on our home. We signed as we did not want to lose our home. They accepted payments from us on this new interest rate from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX while they completed their end of the paperwork. In XXXX of XXXX I was finally able to see details of what our loan looked like. This forced program that we would not have been forced into if it wasn't for one of their employees not completing paperwork in a timely manner added XXXX to our loan; erasing nearly 5 years worth of payments and taking our new principal balance to XXXX. We continued to make payments through XXXX of XXXX, and at closing time they still took a check for XXXX and are currently sending us letters stating we still owe them additional funds. I had called in XXXX of XXXX because the principal balance was not changing as we made payments, also wanting to know where the payments from XXXX of XXXX of XXXX went, and wanting a break down of how this program allowed them to add XXXX to our original loan. They said we signed, so that's just it. We also had no choice but to sign, they would have foreclosed on our home and even threatened to foreclose while accepting monthly payments- their reasoning for the additional threats was that if the paperwork submitted didn't get approved by someone on their team, they would still foreclose anyways.

1. Improper Escrow Charges Shellpoint advanced {$2900.00} to XXXX XXXX that I didn't authorize, when I already had closed with XXXX XXXX XXXX. They also advanced {$370.00} to XXXX XXXX for a tax bill in the previous owner 's name and charged it to my escrow account. I have proof from the tax office receipt and Shellpoint 's own escrow ledger showing this charge. This improper charge, combined with forced-placed insurance that was later canceled, inflated my escrow shortage to {$7300.00}. I'm uncertain what my payment should be.

I mailed : - A {$90000.00} principal reduction check - A {$250.00} recast fee check - A signed recast authorization form - A cover letter making my request clear Shellpoint deposited both checks ( totaling {$90000.00} ) but misapplied the {$250.00} fee to principal rather than recording it as the fee.

This issue is part of a larger pattern. Since XX/XX/year>, when I first inquired about a recast, Shellpoint has : - Given me incorrect information on numerous calls, often contradicting earlier statements- Refused to allow escalation beyond frontline reps- Claimed applications or internal requests were submitted when they were not - Failed to document calls in a way visible to me- Ignored written requests unless I involved the CFPB It has now been over seven months since I first asked about a recast, and Shellpoints delays and errors have cost me thousands of dollars in additional interest payments that should have been avoided once the recast was processed.

11/17/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing a complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing regarding improper lossmitigation handling, dual tracking, and unreasonable demands during my request for a deed in lieu of foreclosure. 

I am the former borrower on a mortgage for the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Washington, DC XXXX. My personal liability on this mortgage was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy on XX/XX/year>. I do not want to keep the property and I submitted a complete loss mitigation package to Shellpoint requesting a deed in lieu of foreclosure. 

Despite submitting all documents requested, Shellpoint continues to move forward with judicial foreclosure at the same time they are processing my deed in lieu request. This appears to be a violation of the federal servicing rules under Regulation X, which prohibit a servicer from moving forward with foreclosure while a complete loss mitigation application is pending.

Shellpoint has now informed me that they need a free and clear deed in order to move forward with the deed in lieu. This requirement is impossible for me to meet because I am not the current titleholder of the property under normal circumstances until the deed in lieu is executed. A deed in lieu is the mechanism that returns title to the lender. I can not produce a free and clear deed before loss mitigation is completed, and Shellpoint knows this. This appears to be an unreasonable and abusive servicing requirement.

Shellpoint is effectively forcing the foreclosure to continue by imposing a condition that a borrower can not meet. This prevents my deed in lieu request from being processed, while foreclosure activity continues in violation of the nodualtracking rule ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ) ).

I want to make clear that I do not want the property and am trying to surrender it. I submitted the requested forms, including Form 710 and additional documentation. Shellpoint has told me the file is incomplete unless I sign a Loss Mitigation OptOut Form, even though I have already requested a deed in lieu. The optout form is typically used to decline loss mitigation, but they are requiring it as a condition of reviewing a deed in lieu. This is confusing, misleading, and appears designed to both move foreclosure forward and avoid offering the deed in lieu option that I am requesting.

I am asking the CFPB to require Shellpoint to : 1. Stop all foreclosure activity immediately while my deed in lieu request is reviewed.

2. Process my deed in lieu without requiring an impossible free and clear deed from me.

3. Confirm in writing whether they will approve or deny the deed in lieu.

4. Stop using forms or requirements that appear to conflict with bankruptcy discharge protections and federal servicing rules.

I am providing copies of communications, my complete loss mitigation application, bankruptcy discharge, and Shellpoints statements regarding the need for a free and clear deed.

12/09/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am the borrower on a first-lien mortgage loan ( account # XXXX ) secured by my primary residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, serviced by NewRez dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint ). Over the past several months, I have filed multiple legitimate complaints with the CFPB regarding Shellpoint 's violations of federal laws, including RESPA ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ), FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR ), such as dual-tracking, failure to respond to Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ), improper fee assessments, and denial of loan modification appeals without proper review. 
Shellpoint has consistently responded to these complaints with identical, copy-pasted boilerplate letters that do not address the specific issues raised. For example : In responses to complaints filed on [ list dates, e.g., XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, etc. ], Shellpoint reused the same generic language, ignoring my requests for detailed loan history, itemized fees, chain of title, and validation of post-bankruptcy charges. 
These responses often include irrelevant or fabricated details, such as referencing events or dates not related to my loan, and fail to comply with RESPA timelines ( e.g., 5-day acknowledgment, 30-day substantive response ).

Despite this, the CFPB has accepted these non-responsive replies as adequate and closed my cases without further investigation. When I provide feedback or file new complaints highlighting this pattern, the cycle repeats, allowing Shellpoint to evade accountability for their unlawful practices. 
Most recently, on or around XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint 's opposing counsel ( from XXXX XXXX ) called my attorney and accused me of "" harassing '' Shellpoint through my CFPB complaints. This is an attempt to silence me and deter me from exercising my legal rights to report violations and seek redress. As a consumer, I have the right under federal law ( e.g., RESPA, FDCPA, and CFPB regulations ) to file complaints without fear of retaliation. Shellpoint 's tactics, including this accusation, constitute unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices ( UDAAP ) under 12 U.S.C. 5531, and may violate anti-retaliation provisions.

This patternShellpoint 's copy-paste responses leading to CFPB closures, followed by accusations of harassment when I persistsuggests systemic issues that the CFPB should investigate. It undermines consumer protections and allows servicers like Shellpoint to continue improper foreclosure activities ( e.g., my trustee 's sale is still posted for XX/XX/XXXX, despite ongoing violations ).",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,12/09/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17884529

10/24/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this urgent complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for repeated violations of federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR, Cal. Civ. Code 2923.6 et seq. ). Shellpoint 's stonewallingthrough their attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX prevented me from obtaining basic confirmation of a loan modification package review, while a foreclosure sale on my primary residence is fast approaching on XX/XX/XXXX. This non-responsiveness is beyond the pale, exacerbating my financial distress and risking wrongful foreclosure on a property with over {$2.00} XXXX in equity. I have substantial evidence of these violations, including an extensive email chain attached here, and I request immediate CFPB intervention to halt the sale and enforce compliance.

Detailed Timeline and Violations : Submission of Complete Loan Modification Package : On XX/XX/XXXX, my authorized advocate, XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, contact : XXXX ), submitted a complete loan modification application on my behalf to Shellpoint. This package included all required financial documentation, as confirmed by XXXX. Under RESPA 1024.41 ( b ) and HBOR 2923.6, Shellpoint must acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and review the application without proceeding to foreclosure ( prohibiting "" dual-tracking '' ). Despite this, Shellpoint has failed to confirm receipt or status, triggering automatic protections against the XX/XX/XXXX, sale date. 
Unanswered Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ) and Inquiries : Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have sent multiple QWRs under RESPA 1024.36 demanding servicing information, including payment history audits, chain of title, Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ) for the CWMB 2007-HY7 Trust, error corrections for inflated arrears ( ~ {$180000.00} disputed ), and foreclosure authority documents. Shellpoint has not acknowledged or responded substantively within the required timelines ( 5 days for acknowledgment, 30 days for response, extendable to 45 ). This violates RESPA, exposing them to statutory damages of up to {$2000.00} per violation plus actual damages ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) ). Attached emails from XX/XX/XXXX, show my detailed QWR demands, which Shellpoint 's attorney dismissed as "" improper discovery requests, '' ignoring RESPA 's broad scope ( see CFPB guidance and Poindexter v. Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp. , 792 F.3d 406 ( 4th Cir. 2015 ) ).

SPOC and Communication Failures : HBOR 2923.7 requires a responsive Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ) for foreclosure prevention. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Shellpoint to speak with a supervisor about the modification package. The supervisor refused to discuss it and referred me to their attorney, XXXX XXXX, claiming they could not assist due to litigation. XXXX XXXX has repeatedly refused to comment or provide updates ( see attached emails dated XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  ). This referral loop constitutes a SPOC violation, as Shellpoint must provide effective assistance regardless of attorney involvement. Prior interactions with SPOC XXXX XXXX were unprofessional and non-responsive, further violating RESPA 1024.40 and HBOR.

Dual-Tracking and Foreclosure Threats : With an active modification review pending, Shellpoint 's refusal to postpone the XX/XX/XXXX, sale violates HBOR 2923.6 's dual-tracking ban and recent California laws like AB 130 ( effective XX/XX/XXXX, restricting high-equity foreclosures ) and SB 1079 ( updated for bidder rights ). Shellpoint claims prior postponements, but the sale was only delayed once ( from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ). Their attorney states "" further applications without material change don't trigger HBOR, '' but my XX/XX/XXXX package demonstrates changed circumstances, including updated financials. This risks wrongful foreclosure under Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. ( 62 Cal. 4th 919, 2016 ), potentially leading to treble damages under Cal. Civ. Code 2924.12.

Ownership and Standing Issues : Shellpoint claims ownership by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) as trustee for the CWMB 2007-HY7 Trust, but XXXX has denied ownership in writing, directing me to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( which disclaimed involvement since XXXX ). The XXXX assignment appears invalid under the trust 's PSA ( 90-day closing window ), nullifying foreclosure authority. Shellpoint has ignored QWR demands for proof, violating RESPA and raising FDCPA 1692g debt validation issues.

Pattern of Non-Compliance : Shellpoint has responded to prior CFPB/DFPI complaints but ignores new ones. Their attorney labels my lawful inquiries as "" harassment '' and demands I cease contact, while including Shellpoint in email chains. This defensive posture suggests underlying compliance issues, as noted in cases like Lucioni v. Bank of America, N.A. ( 3 Cal. App. 5th 150, 2016 ) for HBOR injunctive relief.

Impact on Me : These violations have caused severe emotional distress, financial harm ( e.g., disputed arrears accruing interest ), and the imminent threat of losing my home of over 15 years. With $ XXXX equity, wrongful foreclosure could result in massive damages.

11/07/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Hi- Shellpoint Mortgage reported to the three CRAs that my loan account ( XXXX ) is delinquent, and that i missed payments by more than 30, 60 days. My credit score has since tanked XXXX points. The reason the delinquency happened was because Shellpoint did not have a record of my property/home insurance, ( they say they sent me notices... but I never received any letter or email ... and USPS has no record of that being delivered either ), they bought Force-Placed hazard insurance, which in turn created an Escrow Shortage.

I came to know of all this only after my credit score took a big hit, and a CRA notified me of the hit. Upon knowing the problem, I sent them proof of Insurance which showed I have maintain continuous insurance. They have since, rolled back the Force-Placed hazard insurance, rolled back Escrow shortage, and issued me a cheque for the exact amount they found to be short/delinquent, and the exact amount that was reported delinquent. Since all all this proves I never/do-not owe ( d ) any money to Shellpoint, it makes logical sense to expect Shellpoint to withdraw/rectify the delinquent reporting to the 3 credit bureaus ( Equifax, Transunion and Experian ) as well .

Date Range Covered : XX/XX/year> XX/XX/year> XXXX. Summary of the Problem ( XXXX Ledger Manipulation ) Between XX/XX/year> and XX/XX/year>, my mortgage payment history at Shellpoint/NewRez changed without any new payment, disbursement, or legitimate servicing activity. 

On Day XXXX, the payment history PDF showed XXXX version of my XX/XX/year> transactions. 
On Day XXXX, a new PDF for the same loan, same period, same loan number, showed a different ledger : a new transaction line was inserted, transaction order was changed, and balances shifted without any actual payment or escrow activity. 

In other words, the past was edited in XXXX hours. 

This is not a misunderstanding ; it is XXXX contradictory, system-generated ledgers for the same dates, obtained directly from XXXX online XXXX portal on XXXX consecutive days. 



XXXX. Facts : What Changed Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX For the period surrounding XX/XX/year>, the XXXX PDFs ( downloaded on consecutive days ) show : Day XXXX ledger ( prior PDF ) : XXXX entries on XX/XX/year> : XXXX unapplied/processing entry XXXX regular payment entry Escrow, unapplied, and principal balances associated with those transactions. 

Day XXXX ledger ( new PDF, next day ) : Now there are XXXX entries on XX/XX/year> : XXXX. An unapplied entry for the full payment XXXX. A separate {$750.00} unapplied payment line that did not exist the prior day XXXX. A regular payment line Escrow balance shifts to a more negative value, even though no taxes or insurance were paid and no escrow analysis is shown. 
The principal balance remains the same, but the path to reach that number ( the sequence and classification of transactions ) is different. 

No new payments were made between the issuance of the XXXX PDFs. No reversals, no NSF, no escrow disbursements, no payoff, no modification. The only thing that changed was the content of XXXX own ledger. 

This is not a simple temporary online view issue. I have : XXXX different official Shellpoint payment-history PDFs, for the same loan, covering the same time period, downloaded on consecutive days, which do not match. 



XXXX. Why This Matters : False Delinquency & Fabricated Numbers At the same time these changes appear : The system shows me Past Due : {$5000.00} While also showing : Last payment received before the due date Payment due XX/XX/year> already covered by that payment Next coupon date advanced as if the payment cycle is current. 

That {$5000.00} past due amount is built from : My regular payment amount ( {$3900.00} ) + late charges ( {$1000.00} ) + other fees ( ~ {$75.00} ) The ledger changes from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX appear designed to justify that synthetic past-due figure by recoding or fragmenting prior payments ( e.g., creating a {$750.00} partial unapplied entry that didnt exist the prior day ), instead of reflecting reality. 

This is ledger engineering, not accounting. 



XXXX. Legal Violations Implicated a. XXXX  & XXXX XXXX Payment Application & Error Resolution Under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( k ) and 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( i ) ( ii ), servicers must : correctly apply payments as of the date received, and treat failures in payment application and false information about the loan status as errors requiring investigation and correction. 

By generating XXXX different histories for the same period with conflicting entries and balances, Shellpoint/NewRez are : failing to maintain a consistent, accurate payment history, potentially misapplying or mischaracterizing payments, and creating false delinquency by changing how prior payments are labeled after the fact. 

Regulation XXXX  also requires [ r ] easonable policies and procedures to ensure accurate and timely information, including proper maintenance of documents and data used for servicing. 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ). A system that produces XXXX ledger XXXX day and a different ledger the next, with no underlying transaction, is evidence of a systemic failure of those policies. 

b. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) & Mortgage Servicing Rules Under the TILA servicing rules and XXXX mortgage servicing regulations, periodic statements and histories must be accurate and complete. Generating XXXX incompatible versions of my payment history for the same dates is per XXXX inconsistency and undermines any periodic statement relying on that ledger. 

XXXX XXXX Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices Creating, through internal changes, a false impression that I am past due when : XXXX version of the ledger shows payments applied, another recasts them as unapplied/partial, and the past-due amount appears to be built out of re-labeled payments and extra fees, is deceptive and unfair within the meaning of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536. The consumer can not possibly understand or verify their true obligation if the lender itself can not maintain a stable, consistent ledger for even XXXX hours. 

This sort of conduct is similar in nature to practices previously found unlawful in CFPB servicing actions, where servicers misapplied payments, misrepresented the status of loans, or maintained system data that did not accurately reflect borrower performance.

A VA borrower being declared past due based on a ledger that internally contradicts itself carries heightened risk of : wrongful default/foreclosure, improper fees, and improper reporting to credit bureaus. 

It also undermines the integrity of XXXXguaranteed loan performance reporting. 



XXXX. Evidence Pattern : Systemic, Not XXXX This XXXX shift is not happening in a vacuum. It is consistent with a broader pattern on my account : Repeated contradictions in phone calls about what is due and what has been paid Prior admissions by agents that large amounts ( e.g., ~ {$12000.00} ) sat in unapplied status and then disappeared from the portal Negative escrow balances that dont match disbursement history Past-due statuses despite payments made before the due date A separate incident where I was sent another borrowers foreclosure notice with their financial data blended into mine The XX/XX/year> XXXX change is not an isolated glitch ; it is a snapshot of an actively unstable servicing system that can not reliably maintain a single version of the truth. 



XXXX. Harm and Risk Because of this manipulation and data instability, I face : Artificial past due status based on a ledger that has been rewritten. 
Exposure to wrongful foreclosure activity based on corrupted or altered data. 
Potential damage to my credit if this synthetic delinquency is reported. 
XXXX stress and psychological harm, particularly as a XXXX veteran who is supposed to be protected instead of put at risk by systemic accounting failures. 

If my single loan history can be altered between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX without any real transaction, it is reasonable to suspect other borrowers histories are also changing behind the scenes, especially on this same platform. 



XXXX. Requested Action by CFPB I am requesting : XXXX. XXXX and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, specifically : How multiple versions of a payment history can exist for the same period, generated on different days, with different lines and different balances. 
Whether payment-, escrow-, and fee-posting logic is stable and accurate. 
XXXX. A requirement that Shellpoint/NewRez : Provide a complete, immutable transaction history for my loan from transfer to present, with : all transaction IDs, all system posting dates and effective dates, all reversals, all suspense/unapplied entries, and all internal adjustment codes. 
Explain in writing why my XX/XX/year> transaction set appears differently in XXXX PDFs produced on XXXX consecutive days. 
XXXX. A determination whether : The creation of a {$5000.00} past due figure is based on legitimate missed payments or is the result of post-hoc ledger manipulation and fee stacking. 
There is a pattern-or-practice of generating artificial delinquency and negative escrow through unstable systems. 
XXXX. XXXX from any foreclosure or collection activity while : these inconsistencies exist, and this case is being reviewed by CFPB, VA, and any partnering regulators. 



XXXX. Closing Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year>, my Shellpoint/NewRez payment history changed without a single real-world payment being made. That is not a consumer issue. That is not a misunderstanding. That is a system that can not keep its own story straight for XXXX hours. 

I am asking CFPB to treat this not as a single customer complaint, but as a red-flag indicator of systemic servicing failure, especially given the VA XXXX XXXX the loan and my status as a XXXX veteran.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/19/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17372630
11/19/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"URGENT : Systemic Servicing Platform Failure at NewRez/Shellpoint Creating Imminent Risk of Wrongful Foreclosures, VA Loan Violations, and Conflicting Credit/BK Reporting ( API Breakdown + Orphan-Loan Indicators ) Primary Consumer : XXXX XXXX Product : VA Mortgage Servicer : NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I. Summary of Immediate Harm NewRezs servicing platform is now failing at a software-architecture level. The system is returning XXXX XXXX and XXXX Unauthorized errors across core mortgage-servicing API calls including : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX These error codes mean the servicer can not retrieve federally required disclosures ( Reg Z ), can not retrieve loan details ( RESPA ), and can not properly authenticate borrower records ( FCRA/FDCPA ). This is a direct, active risk of wrongful foreclosure and systemic data corruption affecting me and all other borrowers on this platform. 



XXXX. Nature of the Problem I am a XXXX veteran with a XXXX mortgage. My loan is being serviced off a platform that is returning broken authentication, invalid permission states, missing legal disclosures, and loan-detail failures. This means : They can not verify ownership They can not verify balances They can not access legal disclosures They can not apply or retrieve payments They can not retrieve FDCPA communication preferences They can not validate whether foreclosure actions or delinquency statuses are lawful This is not a glitch. 
This is a systemic data-integrity collapse in a federal mortgage-servicing environment. 



III. Evidence of System Collapse As shown in the screenshots : There was an error retrieving the terms and conditions. 
XXXX XXXX Unauthorized on loan details. 
XXXX XXXX Unauthorized on payment status. 
XXXX XXXX An error has occurred on FDCPA-required communication-preference retrieval. 

401 Unauthorized = the system does not recognize the borrower or loan as valid or authorized.

400 Bad Request = the servicers system can not process the loan data or its identifiers.

A mortgage servicer can not lawfully not recognize a borrower in a live servicing relationship. 



IV. Why This Is a Legal Emergency A. RESPA / Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35, 1024.36 ) API failure preventing access to loan details is a direct violation of : 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) failure to correctly apply payments 1024.35 ( b ) ( 2 ) failure to maintain accurate information 1024.35 ( b ) ( 6 ) failure to provide accurate escrow information 1024.35 ( b ) ( 10 ) Any other error relating to the servicing of a borrowers mortgage loan If the system itself is corrupted, every regulatory obligation collapses.

B. TILA / Regulation Z ( 12 C.F.R. 1026.41 ) The system can not retrieve legally required mortgage disclosures.

Failure to retrieve 1026.41 periodic-statement information is a direct violation.

C. FDCPA ( If NewRez is acting as a debt collector ) The 400/401 errors prevent required disclosures, violating : 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 2 ) false representation of amount or legal status of a debt 15 U.S.C. 1692f ( 1 ) collection of amounts not permitted by law When the system reports delinquency but can not retrieve the loan, it is a per se misleading act.

D. FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) The same platform that can not authenticate the loan is furnishing credit data to Experian showing : Discharged through Chapter 7 Paid off Closed Never late While ongoing collection efforts present the loan as live, delinquent, and in foreclosure trajectory.

This violates : 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) furnishing info known to be inaccurate 1681s-2 ( b ) failure to reasonably investigate and correct disputes The API errors show the underlying system can not validate anything it is reporting.

E. Bankruptcy Code ( 11 U.S.C. 524 ( i ), 105 ( a ) ) Multiple courts ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) have held that misapplied payments and inflated balances after bankruptcy constitute a discharge-injunction violation. 
A system unable to retrieve loan data is incapable of correctly crediting payments. 



F. Dodd-Frank UDAAP ( 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ) A servicing platform returning 400/401 errors during foreclosure-risk conversations is the definition of : Unfair Deceptive Abusive A servicer can not claim delinquency when its system can not retrieve the loan.

G. VA Servicing Rules ( 38 C.F.R. 36.4350 ) VA loans require heightened accuracy, consistency, and communication.

A system that can not authenticate or display loan data is out of compliance.

V. Pattern & Practice NewRez/Shellpoint/Rithm already appear in federal litigation and state enforcement actions for : Misapplied payments Illegal inspection fees Zombie mortgages Bankruptcy-related balance inflation False credit reporting RESPA violations Data-integrity failures These new API failures suggest a full-platform data governance breakdown.

VI. What I Am Requesting from CFPB I request CFPB immediately : Open an enforcement investigation into NewRez and XXXX XXXX. 
Require NewRez to freeze any foreclosure or collection activity until a full audit is completed.

Require a full system-level data integrity audit, including : database logs servicing-platform API logs access-control logs payment-application records error traces for the 400/401 failures Require NewRez to provide the correct loan balance, escrow balance, and amortization history.

Require correction of contradictory Experian reporting.

Evaluate this as a pattern-and-practice UDAAP violation affecting all borrowers using the platform.

This is no longer a my loan issue.

This is a servicing-platform failure affecting every loan in their system.

VII. Damages ( Requested ) Immediate suspension of all negative credit reporting Removal of all late fees, delinquency coding, and charges Full loan accounting audit Compensation for emotional and psychological harm ( XXXX veteran ) System-wide relief for similarly affected VA borrowers Consideration of civil penalties",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/20/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17357358

11/09/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Fees charged,"Formal Complaint Improper and Excessive Lender-Placed Insurance Charges in Violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.37 Dear CFPB Complaints Division, I am filing a formal complaint against Newrez Mortgage ( also operating as Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) regarding improper charges of force-placed hazard insurance on my property at [ redacted ], under Loan XXXX  [ redacted ]. 

Despite providing evidence of building-wide coverage and disputing the charges in writing multiple times ( initially on XX/XX/XXXX, and again on XX/XX/XXXX ), Newrez continues to bill me for a retroactively applied lender-placed policy covering the period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Core Issues : XXXX XXXX : Newrez charged {$3600.00} for roughly XXXX months of limited hazard insurance, spread over XXXX months as a {$61.00} monthly escrow charge. This is over XXXX the market rate, as comparable hazard insurance for the unit typically costs {$330.00} per year. 

XXXX XXXX : My co-op building maintained valid master insurance the entire time. The lender never inquired about this until after placing the policy. 

Lack of Good Faith : After acknowledging notices were sent, Newrez refuses to recognize the clear misapplication of excessive charges and continues to collect escrow in spite of my formal disputes. 

Failure to Remove Escrow Account : I have explicitly requested removal of the escrow account created solely for the illegitimate XXXX  charges. Newrez refuses and continues billing. 

This appears to be a clear violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.37 ( h ) ( 2 ), which prohibits mortgage servicers from imposing unreasonably high charges and requires due diligence before placing insurance. 

I request the CFPB to investigate this matter and compel Newrez to remove these charges, reimburse any collected amounts, and confirm that no negative credit reporting has taken place.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",NY,10801,None,Consent provided,Web,11/09/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17124777
09/18/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","We bought a house in XXXX, XXXX with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX giving us a flood zone of XXXX with a different mortgage company. Therefore, we were not required to get flood insurance and chose not to get it. Shellpoint Mortgage bought our loan in XXXX, XXXX. 

In XXXX, we received a letter from Shellpoint Mortgage stating that we were in a designated flood zone and had 45 days to show proof of insurance or they would get lender-placed insurance. The 45 days ended at approximately XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted Shellpoint Mortgage and sent them our Standard Flood Hazard Determination Letter showing that we did not need flood insurance. There was some back and forth between the Flood Service listed on my Letter and Shellpoints letter, but Shellpoint 's company stated their information from XXXX has our house in a Flood zone. ( We are currently working with XXXX because we believe that while the property is on the edge of XXXX zones, the house is high enough not to require insurance. ) Here is where the problem starts. During this time, we believed we were in good faith making our case that we did not require flood insurance. We waited for the determination from Shellpoint because we expected that we had a legitimate XXXX XXXX that would not require us to have flood insurance. After they rejected our letter, we called a land surveyor who did not return our calls. Since it clearly was going to take longer than we thought to file the XXXX with XXXX, we bought flood insurance for $ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and sent them the paperwork. It was after the 45 days, because we were going back and forth with them trying to show that we did not need the insurance. 

Later in XXXX, Shellpoint sent us a notice saying Lender-placed Insurance was put on the property. The same policy that we obtained for {$1200.00}, they put a $ XXXX lender policy in place and took {$6000.00} out of our escrow, claiming that we had an insurance lapse since they bought the loan in XXXX. They back-dated the lender-based insurance to a time when, as far as both us and Shellpoint knew, we were not required to have flood insurance. They bought our loan without flood insurance. Shellpoint Mortgage has a flood determination date XX/XX/XXXX which is the earliest anyone knew that flood insurance was required on the property. They claim that we are responsible for notifying them of something we had no knowledge of and had just bought the house in XXXX. I do not know why our SFHDF was different, but they bought the loan that way. We did not ask for them to buy our loan. 

When I noticed that they took {$6000.00} out of our escrow in XXXX, I called Shellpoint Mortgage Insurance Division and spoke with a supervisor, XXXX, who told me they could not rescind the lender-based policy but she would file an appeal on my behalf to change the date from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX when we were notified that we needed flood insurance. Even though I thought that was not actually a fair compromise given that we were never told that each day we were communicating with them, they were charging us and that they were charging us for a policy XXXX times the cost XXXX sets, I figured it was a starting point. ( Please see the attached letter sent to us on XX/XX/XXXX. The cost mentioned is vague and says that policy will be put in place in 15 days. There is nothing about back-dating the policy to XXXX. Also, there is no acknoledgement of the appeals that we were making. ) However, they even denied this compromise. {$6000.00} is the cost of 5 years of the flood policy that we have. They basically stole {$6000.00} from our Escrow.

https : XXXX First thing from XXXX is shellpoint is misapplying our P & I payments. Instead of processing them please see our payments. They refuse to process our payment and place them in a "" other '' payment and then charge a late fee illegally. This is exactly what XXXX is saying is illegal practices. 

-- Note we paid .25 % not to escrow on our closing. 

1. First, from our payments, we never EVER missed a mortgage payment. Shellpoint made a mistake and didn't process our change of insurance till after the 4th attempt. We had state farm try and they also use a 3rd party website we had to upload. 

2. Due to the fact they messed up there was a second mistake at our closing about a {$1700.00} local tax bill that we paid but didn't get submitted. Due to that fact Shellpoint increase our escrow over XXXX which wasn't even close to correct over a {$1700.00} mistake. ( screenshot attached ). How they get XXXX from {$1700.00} is crazy. 

- On XX/XX/XXXX we repaid the mistake about the escrow and also paid XXXX taxes. Therefore escrow was taken care of. 

- Shellpoint continued to overcharge XXXX of escrow for {$1700.00} ( attached was paid bill ). 

XXXX {$8000.00} we paid our mortgage payment XXXX {$8000.00} we paid our mortgage payment XXXX {$11000.00} we paid our mortgage payment XXXX paid part of their incorrect escrow payment. You can see XXXX - XXXX not only paid for XXXX taxes ( which we already paid for ) but over paid for it. They were over charging us What shellpoint does illegal. Is when you make a payment for principle and interest they misapply it to a category "" Unapplied payment ''. This is in direct violation to CFPB rules. 

See below "" unapplied payment '' even though we called in to make our principle and interest payment. They refuse to apply it correctly. 

XXXX {$11000.00} XX/XX/XXXX Unapplied Payment They knew what this payment was for yet purposely apply it incorrectly to charge a late fee. 

https : //www.eplaw.us/practice-areas/consumer-credit-and-debt/illegal-mortgage-late-fees/ has more information on how this is an illegal act. 

-Shellpoint started charging late fees and interest on escrow payments. They created a late fee by misapplying a payment and reported it late.

on XX/XX/XXXX they charged a late fee on sending us BACK escrow. 

On XX/XX/XXXX they forced us to pay them back for their mistake WHILE charging us a late fee and reporting a late fee to the credit agency.

Attn : General Counsel / Chief Legal Officer Re : Renewed Litigation Hold & Preservation of Evidence Notice Loan No. : XXXX | Property : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX Borrower : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX P & T XXXX Veteran, VA Loan ) To Counsel and Compliance : This letter serves as a renewed, expanded, and formal LITIGATION HOLD / PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE NOTICE. 

It is being issued because you improperly closed a prior RESPA Notice of Error and related disputes as duplicate without providing the investigation, written findings, or corrections required by law, and despite your actual knowledge that the account is in active dispute, that regulatory complaints are pending, and that litigation and enforcement are reasonably anticipated. 

Your decision to treat a lawful error notice and legal hold as duplicate is evidence of willful disregard of your preservation obligations and will be presented as such to courts and regulators. 



I. Background : Prior Legal Hold & RESPA Notice Ignored XXXX. I previously issued a RESPA Notice of Error under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 and explicitly placed you on notice that : the loan ledger is corrupted ; unapplied funds were used to manufacture delinquency ; a false XX/XX/XXXX default / pre-foreclosure notice was issued ; call recordings contain admissions that only {$750.00} was due while you held {$12000.00} in unapplied ; and a complaint and investigation were pending with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX. I also made clear that litigation and enforcement were reasonably anticipated and that all relevant evidence must be preserved. 
XXXX. Rather than comply, you : caused at least XXXX RESPA Notice of Error to be closed as duplicate ; failed to provide a compliant written response under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ) ; and continued using corrupted data to threaten foreclosure and assess fees. 

This conduct signals a conscious attempt to dodge legal and regulatory obligations, not a good-faith response to a borrower error notice. 

For avoidance of doubt : this letter renews and broadens the litigation hold. 



XXXX. Duty to Preserve Litigation & Enforcement Are Reasonably Anticipated There is no question that you are on notice of potential litigation and regulatory action. Among other things : Multiple RESPA Notices of Error and RFIs have been submitted. 
Numerous CFPB complaints have been filed, including but not limited to XXXX and related complaint numbers. 
XXXX has opened a complaint and received your XX/XX/XXXX response letter regarding my loan. 
The loan involves a XXXX mortgage to a 100 % permanent & total XXXX veteran facing wrongful foreclosure threats. 
You issued a pre-foreclosure notice while holding substantial funds in unapplied status. 
I have explicitly raised claims under RESPA, Regulation X, FDCPA, FCRA, Dodd-Frank UDAAP , Tennessee consumer-protection law, VA servicing standards, and potential securities/controls issues at the Rithm level. 

Under well-established spoliation doctrine and federal law, including Fed. XXXX XXXX. P. XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ( XXXX ) and cases such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX F.R.D. XXXX ( S.D.N.Y. XXXX ), and XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ), your duty to preserve evidence arises when litigation is reasonably anticipated, not when a complaint is actually filed in court. 

That standard has been met several times over. 



XXXX. Scope of the Litigation Hold What Must Be Preserved Effective immediately, you are directed to suspend all routine and ad hoc destruction, overwriting, or alteration of any materials potentially relevant to : my loan ( Loan No. [ XXXX ] ), your servicing systems and practices, and your responses to regulators and investors. 

This includes, without limitation : XXXX. Loan-Level Records & Ledgers Full payment history for my account from XX/XX/XXXX to present, including every version of the ledger ( before and after any reversals, adjustments, or modifications ). 
All records of unapplied/suspense funds, reversals, and reclassifications. 
All escrow analyses and escrow transaction histories. 
XXXX. Default, Foreclosure, & Collection Activity Copies ( and system templates ) of all default, acceleration, and pre-foreclosure notices, including the XX/XX/XXXX letter. 
Internal notes, workflows, and servicing system entries related to any decision to code my loan as delinquent or refer it to foreclosure. 
All property inspection requests, invoices, and reports ; all entries for inspection fees or property-preservation fees. 
XXXX. Call Recordings, Transcripts, and Internal Notes Audio recordings and/or transcripts of all calls with me and with XXXX XXXX referencing this loan, especially the calls on and around : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX calls quoting conflicting payment amounts XXXX XXXX XXXX calls about unapplied funds and property inspections All internal agent notes, servicing comments, and escalation logs tied to those calls. 
XXXX. Compliance, Risk, Audit, and Complaint Files All internal complaint files, including CFPB, XXXX, and internal case or ticket systems related to my account. 
Any internal audits, QA reviews, risk assessments, or root cause analyses addressing unapplied funds, false delinquency, XXXX servicing, or duplicative/erroneous default notices. 
All documents relating to your decision to mark my RESPA Notice of Error and complaints as duplicate. 
XXXX. Policies, Procedures, & System Documentation Servicing policies/procedures for : unapplied funds, suspense accounts, default/foreclosure initiation, VA-loan handling, property inspections, escrow analysis, and RESPA Notices of Error. 
System documentation or vendor contracts for platforms used to service my loan ( payment processing systems, collections platforms, dialer/phone systems, recording systems, document-generation platforms, etc. ). 
XXXX. Emails & ESI ( Electronically Stored Information ) Emails, chat messages, Teams/Slack messages , and other ESI among employees, managers, compliance staff, and executives concerning : my loan, unapplied funds and payment reversals, my CFPB and XXXX complaints, treatment of my prior legal hold notices, instructions on how to respond to my RESPA notices XXXX and decision-making about closing items as duplicate. 
Communications with any outside counsel or vendors, including but not limited to foreclosure counsel, collection agencies, sub-servicers, and XXXX corporate/legal. 
XXXX. Rithm / NewRez XXXX Shellpoint / Investor-Level Communications Communications between NewRez/Shellpoint and XXXX XXXX XXXX relating to my loan, similar loans, unapplied funds policies, or handling of XXXX accounts.

This preservation requirement extends to all locations where such information may be stored, including on-premises servers, cloud systems, laptops, mobile devices, backup tapes, archives, and XXXX-party vendors. 



IV. Closing Prior Matters as Duplicate Does NOT Extinguish Your Legal Hold Obligations Your recent behavior, including : closing prior RESPA Notices of Error as duplicate, issuing non-substantive CFPB responses, and refusing to provide a compliant written RESPA response, does not terminate or diminish your duty to preserve evidence. 

To the contrary, it will be argued as proof of willful noncompliance and bad-faith spoliation risk, including : an attempt to avoid creating a discoverable paper trail of your errors ; a pattern of dodging Regulation X obligations ; and deliberate efforts to minimize documentary exposure while continuing harmful servicing conduct. 

Any destruction or alteration of relevant data after receipt of this letter will be treated as knowing spoliation and cited in support of : adverse inference instructions, evidentiary preclusion, monetary sanctions, and expanded damages claims. 



XXXX Confirmation of Hold & Point of Contact Within 14 days of receipt of this letter, please : XXXX. Confirm in writing that a litigation hold has been implemented, XXXX. Identify the individual ( XXXX ) responsible for coordinating your response and preservation efforts, and XXXX. Confirm that routine deletion, overwriting, and data-retention schedules have been suspended as to all categories identified in XXXX XXXX. 

Failure to confirm will not relieve you of your obligations ; it will only strengthen the argument that any loss of evidence was willful or reckless. 



VI. Reservation of Rights Nothing in this letter waives any rights or remedies I may hold under : RESPA / Regulation X ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ; 12 C.F.R. pt. 1024 ), FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. ), FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ), Dodd-Frank UDAAP ( 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ), VA servicing rules and related regulations, Tennessee state law, or any other applicable federal or state law, including securities-related obligations at the XXXX level.

Prior to this, I submitted an application for a VA mortgage modification under the VASP program. The process took approximately five monthsthree times the estimated durationdue to an error attributed to Shellpoint.

During the application period, Shellpoint did not provide written notification that the mortgage would be reported as delinquent. I was verbally informed that no payments would be required while the application was under review. Throughout the five-month review period, no delinquency was reported to the credit bureaus. However, following approval of the modification, Shellpoint reported the mortgage as 120 days late. 

Approximately XXXX months into the process, Shellpoint informed me that the modification was being denied due to a lien on the property.

I made that manual payment on XX/XX/year>. 

On XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint still withdrew an additional full mortgage payment, overdrawing my account and triggering bank fees. 

When I called, Shellpoint admitted the error but told me I must wait until XX/XX/XXXX and then request a refund, which would only be issued by check after 710 business days.

I requested escalation to the Office of the President but was denied and told my only option was to submit something in writing through their web portal. However, when I followed this advice, I discovered that no such form, email address, or tool exists on their website. This made their advice completely useless and prevented me from submitting a formal complaint internally.

This situation is unacceptable. I was proactive, followed all instructions, and communicated extensively to ensure payments were timely. Shellpoints system error and poor customer service caused me significant financial hardship.

I request that the CFPB investigate Shellpoints practices and require them to : 1. Issue immediate electronic refund of the duplicate payment.

2. Fully reimburse my overdraft and bank fees.

3. Improve transparency of their auto-pay system.

4. Ensure consumers can escalate complaints to senior management without obstruction.

5. Provide a written explanation for why my request to escalate directly to the Office of the President was denied, contrary to proper consumer complaint-handling practices under federal regulations.

This matter has caused significant financial harm due to Newrezs failure to properly execute instructions that were repeatedly confirmed to me. 
Over the course of last year, I contacted Newrez on close to 7 separate occasions to request the removal of my escrow account. As part of this process, I complied with all requirements provided by Newrez Mortgages representatives, including paying for and obtaining an appraisal at my own expense. Following this, my Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) was removed, and I was explicitly informed on multiple phone calls that my escrow account had also been deactivated as well. 
Relying on these confirmations, I continued to pay my property taxes directly, as I had been instructed to do. 
However, nearly a year later, when I logged into my account to make my regular mortgage payment, I discovered that Newrez had paid approximately {$18000.00} in property taxes from an escrow account that should not have been active. These taxes had already been paid by me directly. As a result, this payment was unauthorized, unnecessary, and entirely avoidable had my escrow account been properly removed as confirmed multiple times by Newrez representatives. 
This represents a serious servicing failure, including but not limited to : Failure to properly process and execute my escrow removal request Providing inaccurate and misleading information over multiple calls Making an unauthorized payment on my behalf for an obligation that had already been satisfied Creating a financial discrepancy that I should not be responsible for correcting",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",FL,33193,None,Consent provided,Web,01/20/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18762264

This failure to disclose is a material omission, and the failure to credit payments as received appears to be an error in the application of payments, in violation of XXXX C.F.R. XXXX ( c ) and XXXX C.F.R. XXXX ( b ) ( XXXX ) ( improper application of payments / failure to apply payments received ). 

The representative I spoke with confirmed that although you offer a bi-weekly option, you only credit the account once the total monthly amount is received, meaning you are holding my funds while interest continues accruing to my detriment. This contradicts reasonable consumer expectations for an offered bi-weekly payment program.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,93455,None,Consent provided,Web,11/26/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17933725

I submitted the same documentation that was submitted to Newrez to Shellpoint. * I even sent a copy of a letter confirming that I was indeed the successor from Newrez.

NR/SMS/CAL is furnishing late payment information on my mortgage account that I dispute as inaccurate and unsupported.

I have disputed these late payments and am requesting documentation-based proof or correction.

Account and Items in Dispute NR/SMS/CAL ( Mortgage ) Acct : XXXX Disputed late payments reported for : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I dispute the accuracy, completeness, and reporting basis of these late payment notations.

Basis of Complaint Mortgage servicing errors frequently involve misapplied payments, escrow changes, or the use of suspense/unapplied funds, which can cause incorrect delinquency reporting even when payments were made. NR/SMS/CAL has continued to report the above late payments without providing documentation sufficient to validate the alleged delinquency and the manner in which payments were applied.

To properly substantiate the reporting, NR/SMS/CAL should be able to provide complete records for each disputed month, including : The monthly mortgage statements showing the contractual due date and amount due ( including escrow changes ) ; A complete payment history/transaction ledger showing date received and date posted/applied; A breakdown of payment application ( principal, interest, escrow, fees ) and whether any funds were placed into suspense/unapplied status ; Any servicing notes, notices, or policies relied upon to determine delinquency ; and The exact basis and date the account was first treated as past due for each disputed billing cycle.

Loan numbers : XXXX or XXXX ( discrepancy noted below ). This is part of a pattern of non-responsiveness, including ignored Qualified Written Requests XXXX XXXX XXXX refusal to assign a responsive Single Point of Contact XXXX XXXX  ), and dual tracking, as detailed in my prior CFPB complaints and pending lawsuit ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Case No. XXXX, filed XX/XX/year> ). 
On or about XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint denied my complete loss mitigation application, citing failed XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) calculations, insufficient hardship verification, and other errors. I submitted a timely formal appeal on XX/XX/year>, pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( h ), demanding re-evaluation due to material errors and procedural deficiencies. 

Incomplete Evaluation of Submitted Materials ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( c ) ) : Shellpoint failed to thoroughly evaluate my complete application, ignoring or deeming "" insufficient '' my hardship affidavit, medical/employment records, bank statements, and income documentation without adequate explanation. This violates RESPA 's requirement to assess all submitted materials before denial. 

Deficient XXXX Calculations and Non-Disclosure ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( d ) ( 2 ) ) : The denial relies on flawed XXXX  inputs, including an undervalued property assessment. My attached professional appraisal values the property at {>= $1,000,000} ( with unique features : XXXX acres, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and current XXXX listings XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX higher than Shellpoint 's estimate. They have not disclosed XXXX inputs, assumptions, or methodologies, despite my demands, hindering my appeal. Re-calculation with accurate data would likely pass XXXX XXXXor investor guidelines XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Trustee for XXXX XXXX ). 
XXXX ( XXXX ) Ratio Errors XXXX Shellpoint 's XXXX calculation appears mathematically incorrect based on undervaluation, disqualifying me from streamline programs ( thresholds often 125 % or less ). 

Using my appraisal, XXXX is well below thresholds. They must disclose exact figures used and re-evaluate. 

XXXX XXXX Violations ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ) and California XXXX, XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX ) : Shellpoint advanced foreclosure ( sale postponed to XX/XX/year> ) while my complete application was under review and now during appeal. This prohibits foreclosure progression during evaluation/appeal of a complete application. My lawsuit alleges related XXXX violations, including no responsive XXXX despite demands. 
XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ) : The denial uses loan XXXX XXXXXXXX, but the XXXX assignment ( XX/XX/year> ) uses XXXX XXXXXXXX, raising concerns about accurate records and whether the correct account was reviewed.

Failure to Coordinate with Homeowner Assistance Fund ( HAF ) : I am pursuing HAF via calhaf.ca.gov for supplemental relief, but Shellpoint has not coordinated evaluation, ignoring good-faith requirements to consider all options. 

Pattern of Servicing Errors : This denial follows a history of issues, including over XXXX ignored XXXX/debt validation requests ( e.g., XX/XX/year> letter received XX/XX/XXXX ), refusal to discuss due to litigation ( despite self-representation ), and coercive post-bankruptcy collection attempts ( debt discharged ).

Shellpoint was fully aware of my refinance plans, and the transfer has created unnecessary complications and financial stress. I believe this action was not in good faith and may have violated consumer protection standards regarding mortgage servicing and loan transfers during active refinancing.

In reality, my account has been payed ahead of the monthly structured payment schedule ( 26 half payments versus the scheduled 12 full payments ).

The mortgage company does offer an ACH option for the bi-weekly schedule, but participating in allowing them to extract funds from my account is not an option that works for me for two reasons. First, as a habit, I do not allow companies permission to draft from my accounts, I push payments from my account. Second, utilizing my banks bill-pay feature affords me visibility of my financial forecast.

I have confirmed with my financial institution, xxxxx, that the payment was successfully processed and cleared on XX/XX/year>. Despite this, the payment does not appear on my loan account records. As a result, I received several calls notifying me that my payment was late, incorrect amounts reported to all three credit reporting bureaus, and a delay in refinancing and loan obtainment. Because of this, I was forced to make a payment due to the error on Shellpoint 's part, in order to quickly resolve this issue. 

I respectfully request that you investigate this matter promptly and ensure the payment is correctly applied to my account in the form of a credit, or a cash refund. Furthermore, my account should be credited the amount of interest paid on the overpayment amount from XX/XX/year> to the present. 

Please confirm receipt of this letter and notify me in writing once the issue has been resolved. Please find attachments enclosed. If further documentation is required, I will be happy to provide it. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.

This caused my required monthly mortgage payment to increase from {$1000.00} to {$6100.00}, while I was still protected by the automatic stay and making timely Trustee payments.

11/19/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"IMMINENT HARM Orphan Servicing, Denied Ownership, and Void Loan Enforcement by XXXX XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Product and Company Product : XXXX residential mortgage Companies involved : NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXX ( alleged parent of NewRez LLC ) What happened I am a 100 % permanent and total XXXX veteran with a XXXX-backed mortgage that is being serviced by NewRez LLC / Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, which publicly claims to be owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX However, in multiple written responses to my CFPB complaints, these entities have denied ownership, denied parent-subsidiary status, and denied servicing responsibility, effectively placing my loan into what I will call orphan status. 

An orphan loan is one where the claimed servicer and the alleged parent/owner explicitly disclaim any ownership, authority, or legal linkage over the loan, while still attempting to collect payments and threaten foreclosure. That is exactly what is happening here. 

1. Conflicting ownership and wrong company responses XXXX XXXX represents in SEC filings and public investor materials that NewRez LLC and Shellpoint are its wholly owned subsidiaries and key servicing platforms generating its mortgage servicing income. 
In contrast, my CFPB complaint responses from XXXXNewRez/Shellpoint repeatedly state wrong company, we dont service this loan, or deny that XXXX is the parent of NewRez and that NewRez/Shellpoint are related entities, despite those SEC and investor representations.

NewRez/Shellpoint have also denied servicing responsibility or legal ownership while still sending me mortgage statements, default/collection notices, and threats tied to foreclosure. 

These positions can not all be true. If XXXX is not the parent and NewRez/Shellpoint deny linkage, then no entity in this chain is acknowledging legal ownership or authority to enforce my promissory note and deed of trust. That creates an orphan loan with no valid party entitled to enforce it. 

2. Orphan status = no standing to collect or foreclose Under mortgage and UCC principles, a party may only enforce a negotiable promissory note and secured deed of trust if it is a person entitled to enforce the note ( XXXX ) or an authorized agent for such a person. Courts have held that : A foreclosure is invalid if brought by a party that does not hold the mortgage or can not demonstrate a valid assignment at the time of foreclosure ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). 
A creditor or servicer must prove it is the party entitled to enforce the note and related security instrument to have standing ( XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Here, NewRez/Shellpoint and XXXX have , in writing to the CFPB, disclaimed parentage, ownership, and servicing authority while still attempting to bill and collect from me. If they are not the owner, not the parent, and not even the correct company, then they are not the XXXX, not a lawful mortgagee, and have no standing to collect, report, or foreclose on my XXXX  mortgage. 

3. Servicing while denying ownership is an unfair, deceptive, and abusive practice ( UDAAP ) Despite denying ownership and linkage : NewRez/Shellpoint continue to accept and demand monthly mortgage payments. 
They continue to send account statements, collection notices, and foreclosure-related communications. 
They continue to manipulate ledgers and escrow while refusing to correctly acknowledge who actually owns or has authority over my loan.

Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, it is unlawful for covered persons or service providers to engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products or services. 

Servicing a loan while simultaneously denying any ownership, parentage, or servicing responsibility is : Unfair : It causes substantial injury ( threats of foreclosure, misapplied payments, emotional and financial harm ) that consumers can not reasonably avoid and that has no legitimate countervailing benefit. 
Deceptive : Consumers are misled as to who owns their loan, who is authorized to collect, and who has authority to modify or foreclose. 
Abusive : Consumers reasonably rely on the servicer and parent company to act in their interest, while those entities exploit that reliance by collecting on a loan they disclaim authority to enforce. 

This is especially abusive against me as a 100 % permanent and total XXXX veteran with a XXXX loan. 

4. RESPA / Regulation X violations from error notices about ownership and mis-servicing I have repeatedly given written and electronic notice of serious servicing errors, including : Conflicting loan balances and ledgers Misapplied or unapplied funds Receipt of another borrowers foreclosure financial documents ( clear data/servicing contamination ) Contradictions in who owns/controls my loan Threats of foreclosure while these issues remained unresolved Under Regulation Xs error resolution procedures, any written notice asserting an error in the servicing of a mortgage loan is a notice of error, and the servicer must investigate and either correct the error or provide a written explanation with supporting documents. 

Instead, NewRez/ShellpointXXXX : Responded with wrong company or ownership denials instead of resolving the core error. 
Continued to bill, collect, and threaten foreclosure while those ownership and ledger errors remained outstanding. 

Servicing a loan as if they are the owner/authorized servicer while simultaneously telling the CFPB they are not the owner/parent/servicer is a continuing Regulation X violation and a UDAAP. 

5. Systemwide risk : every NewRez/Shellpoint/XXXX  loan similarly affected is potentially unenforceable Because XXXX touts NewRez and Shellpoint as its core servicing platforms in SEC filings and investor presentations, yet NewRez/Shellpoint and XXXX have used wrong company and ownership-denial language in CFPB responses, the orphan-servicing problem is not just about my loan. It appears systemic. 

If NewRez and Shellpoint deny linkage to XXXX and deny ownership/servicing responsibility in formal responses while still collecting on loans, then : Every loan they service under this structure is at risk of orphan status. 
Every borrower in that situation is being subjected to potentially illegal collections, escrow manipulations, and foreclosure threats without a lawfully identified owner or XXXX. 
XXXX is being enriched by servicing income and cash flows from loans that, based on their own statements, they deny owning or legally controlling. 

This raises systemic UDAAP and RESPA concerns across the entire Rithm/NewRez/Shellpoint servicing book, not just my account. 



What I want the CFPB to do For my individual loan : Determine that, based on the companies own written denials of ownership, parentage, and servicing responsibility, NewRez/Shellpoint/XXXX  do not have standing or authority to collect, report, or enforce my mortgage. 
Treat my loan as legally unenforceable by these entities and require them to : Immediately cease all collection activity, including billing, phone calls, letters, and credit reporting. 
Immediately cease any foreclosure activity or threats, including acceleration notices or foreclosure referrals. 
Provide a full chain-of-title and XXXX verification, identifying the true owner or stating on the record that no lawful owner/servicer can be identified. 
Correct all tradeline reporting and remove any negative credit information they have furnished while denying ownership/authority. 

For systemic relief : Open a supervisory and enforcement investigation into XXXX XXXX, NewRez LLC, and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for : Collecting and foreclosing on loans where they have denied ownership, parentage, or servicing responsibility in CFPB responses or other regulatory communications. 
Violating RESPA/Regulation X servicing rules and the CFPBs UDAAP authority by operating orphan servicing platforms. 
Require these entities to : Identify and remediate every loan where a borrower is being serviced or foreclosed upon by an entity that has denied ownership/linkage. 
Cease all collections and foreclosure activity on such loans until a lawful owner/XXXX and agency authority are documented and disclosed to affected consumers. 
Provide restitution, fee refunds, and credit repair for borrowers who were billed, defaulted, or foreclosed upon by an entity that denied ownership or servicing authority. 
Consider civil money penalties and injunctive relief to ensure that XXXX/NewRez/Shellpoint can not continue to operate an orphan-servicing model that enriches XXXX on loans it disclaims. 

As a XXXX veteran with a XXXX loan, I am asking the CFPB to treat this as a high-priority matter affecting not only my home, but potentially thousands of other borrowers ( including servicemembers and veterans ) whose mortgages may already be in the same unlawful orphan status.

At that time, I was informed that escrow could potentially be removed after 60 days. 
However, since then, the servicing of my mortgage has been transferred to a new company Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. Upon contacting Shellpoint to follow up on the escrow removal timeline, I was told that escrow can not be removed until 12 months have passed. 
This is a significant change from the original information I received, and I would like clarification on the following : Why has the timeline for escrow removal changed from 60 days to 12 months? 
Is this policy specific to Shellpoint, or is it based on broader regulatory or loan-specific requirements? 
Is there any documentation or written policy that outlines the conditions for escrow removal under Shellpoints servicing?

11/24/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,"An existing modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or other loss mitigation relief","Please see attached rebuttal to complaint XXXX, outlining all the violations.

Thank you for reviewing my complaint. I am submitting this rebuttal because Shellpoint 's response contains significant inaccuracies, omissions, and unresolved issues. Their response does not address the core problems, and the servicing errors remain ongoing. I respectfully request that CFPB re-open my complaint for further investigation.

1. SHELLPOINT 'S RESPONSE OMITS KEY FACTS AND FAILS TO ADDRESS DOCUMENTED ERRORS Several major issues remain unresolved : ( a ) Payments were rejected and returned after my loss mitigation application was acknowledged as complete.

Shellpoint 's letter dated XX/XX/XXXX states my application was complete and foreclosure protection was in place. After that date : Multiple weekly payments were rejected One payment was returned by check ( XX/XX/XXXX payment rejected XX/XX/XXXX ) Additional payments attempted through my bank were rejected These payment rejections are not addressed anywhere in Shellpoint 's response.

( b ) Payment rejection pattern demonstrates bad faith Timeline of Shellpoint 's inconsistent conduct : XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX : Accepted my weekly {$170.00} payments XX/XX/XXXX : Rejected payments and referred loan to foreclosure attorney XX/XX/XXXX : Resumed accepting payments XX/XX/XXXX : Rejected payments again ( starting with XX/XX/XXXX payment, rejected XX/XX/XXXX ) This pattern prevents me from curing any actual delinquency and demonstrates Shellpoint 's bad faith in servicing my account.

2. XXXX ADMITS ( AND SHELLPOINT INHERITED ) SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNTING ERRORS FROM XXXX Shellpoint 's XX/XX/XXXX response specifically acknowledges errors made by the prior servicer ( XXXX  ) : "" Errors were found in the construction of your XXXX-approved loan modification during XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX '' "" Payments received between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXprior to the modification being bookedwere not applied according to the modification terms, contributing to further delinquency '' While these errors occurred under XXXXXXXX XXXX servicing ( before Shellpoint took over in XX/XX/XXXX ), Shellpoint : Inherited an account with known errors Took responsibility for these errors in their CFPB response Has NOT corrected the errors Is attempting to foreclose based on a delinquency created by these admitted errors Within 8 months of taking over servicing ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ), Shellpoint filed a Notice of Default without : Correcting the inherited accounting errors Providing accurate accounting of my payments Giving me fair opportunity to cure any actual shortfall Properly crediting my payments made under Shellpoint 's servicing CRITICAL : The alleged delinquency that Shellpoint is foreclosing on was created by XXXXXXXX XXXX admitted errors , which Shellpoint has failed to correct.

3. SHELLPOINT INCONSISTENTLY APPLIED THE XXXX MODIFICATION PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION IS EVIDENCE THE MODIFICATION WAS ACTIVE Although Shellpoint claims the modification was not implemented, their own records and my current loan terms show : My current interest rate ( 4.125 % ) is the same rate contained in the XXXX modification My current monthly payment amount ( {$660.00} ) matches the XXXX modification payment exactly This indicates Shellpoint did implement parts of the modification, contradicting their written statement. Partial implementation is a recognized form of contract acceptance and raises serious concerns about the accuracy of their foreclosure basis.

Moreover, I have been making payments in good faith reliance on the modification agreement since XX/XX/XXXX. 
4. PRINCIPAL BALANCE FIGURES ARE INCONSISTENT AND UNEXPLAINED Shellpoint 's letter lists contradictory principal balance figures : Loan history principal : {$110000.00} My loan history downloaded from Shellpoint 's system shows : {$110000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) My XXXX modification agreement states : {$110000.00} Shellpoint 's XXXX proposed modification lists : {$120000.00} These figures contradict each other by more than {$10000.00} with no explanation.

Shellpoint provided no breakdown of : Which fees were capitalized Why the balance increased by $ XXXX despite payments made What calculations were used Whether misapplied payments from XXXX were corrected How the 13-year draw period error affected the balance This is directly responsive to my RESPA Notice of Error, yet they did not provide the required explanation under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ).

5. SHELLPOINT CONFIRMS THE DRAW PERIOD WAS INCORRECTLY RECORDED Their letter states their system incorrectly showed the draw period ending XX/XX/XXXX, when it actually ended XX/XX/XXXX ( per my original HELOC terms : 60-month draw period from XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Shellpoint claims they corrected the draw period end date to XX/XX/XXXX after I brought it to their attention. This is STILL WRONG. My original HELOC agreement shows a 60-month ( 5-year ) draw period starting XX/XX/XXXX. Correct draw period end date : XX/XX/XXXX ( not XXXX, not XXXX ). 
This means : The loan was serviced with fundamentally incorrect information Payments may have been applied as "" draw period '' ( interest-only ) when they should have been applied to principal Possible over-accrual of interest occurred The XXXX modification calculations may have been based on incorrect principal balance Their accounting is demonstrably unreliable Even Shellpoint 's `` correction '' to XX/XX/XXXX is still wrong by 5 years This directly impacts the accuracy of the principal balance, arrears calculation, and modification terms, yet Shellpoint provided no explanation of : How this error affected payment application Whether they recalculated the balance What my principal balance should actually be with correct payment application Whether the modification balance of {$110000.00} was calculated using the wrong draw period assumption 6. SHELLPOINT DID NOT RESPOND TO MULTIPLE REQUIRED RESPA/RFI ITEMS My Notice of Error and Request for Information requested : Full itemization of arrears with dates and amounts Payment-by-payment transaction history showing application to principal, interest, fees Itemization of capitalized amounts Explanation for conflicting principal balances Documentation related to rejected payments All internal servicing notes regarding the XXXX modification Complete accounting from XX/XX/XXXX to present Explanation of how bankruptcy trustee payments were applied Shellpoint did not provide or address these items. Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ) requires a substantive response to a Notice of Error. Their response is incomplete and does not satisfy their legal obligations under RESPA.

7. SHELLPOINT 'S DENIAL OF DUAL TRACKING IS CONTRADICTED BY THE PAYMENT REJECTIONS AND TIMELINE Shellpoint claims foreclosure proceedings were paused during loss mitigation review. However, the timeline contradicts this : XX/XX/XXXX : Loan servicing transferred to Shellpoint XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint refers loan to foreclosure attorney ( per their letter ) XX/XX/XXXX : Notice of Default recorded XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint acknowledges my loss mitigation application is complete After XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint rejects multiple payments XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint sends CFPB response claiming delinquency Rejecting payments while a loss mitigation application is under review : ( 1 ) Prevents the borrower from curing any delinquency ( 2 ) Causes the alleged arrears to grow ( 3 ) Constitutes advancement of foreclosure proceedings ( 4 ) Violates the dual tracking prohibition under California Civil Code 2923.6 and Regulation X 8. SHELLPOINT FABRICATED A LOSS MITIGATION APPLICATION- I MADE NO SUCH APPLICATION Shellpoint 's XX/XX/XXXX letter states I submitted a complete loss mitigation application as of XX/XX/XXXX. 
THIS IS CATEGORICALLY FALSE. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, my ONLY contact with Shellpoint was : - Making my regular weekly {$170.00} bill pay payments - Payments made through my bank 's automated bill pay system - No other communication of any kind I did NOT in XX/XX/XXXX : - Submit any loss mitigation application ( online, mail, fax, or in person ) - Call Shellpoint to request loss mitigation - Email Shellpoint about loss mitigation - Send any documents to Shellpoint- Authorize anyone to apply on my behalf - Log into any Shellpoint online portal - Sign any application forms I have bank records proving my only activity was routine bill pay payments. Shellpoint fabricated this application. Why would Shellpoint do this?

1. To create appearance of regulatory compliance : By claiming to 'evaluate ' me for loss mitigation, they appear to comply with regulations requiring servicers to consider alternatives to foreclosure.

2. To justify quick denial : They could 'evaluate ' the fake application and deny it ( XX/XX/XXXX ), claiming they considered alternatives.

3. To justify payment rejections : While 'evaluating ' the fake application, they rejected my payments ( starting XX/XX/XXXX ), increasing alleged arrears.

4. To avoid honoring my XX/XX/XXXX modification : By treating me as a new applicant rather than someone with an existing modification.

TIMELINE OF FABRICATED APPLICATION SCHEME : - XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint determines application complete - XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint sends letter acknowledging application and telling me to continue to make your monthly payments - XX/XX/XXXX : I make my regular weekly {$170.00} payment ( following their XX/XX/XXXX instruction ) - XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint REJECTS my XX/XX/XXXX payment. Shellpoint also cuts me a check for my XX/XX/XXXX payment ( 5 days after telling me to make payments ). 
- XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint denies fabricated application ( only 14 days later ) - XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint tells CFPB they're in compliance with regulations This is fraud. Shellpoint : 1. Fabricated an application I never submitted 2. Used it to create false paper trail 3. Rejected my payments immediately after acknowledging the fake application 4. Quickly denied the application they fabricated 5. Used this charade to advance foreclosure while claiming regulatory compliance I request CFPB investigate : 1. What application Shellpoint claims to have received XX/XX/XXXX 2. What documents they claim I submitted 3. How I allegedly submitted this application 4. Whether Shellpoint has any record of actual communication from me in XX/XX/XXXX 5. Whether Shellpoint has engaged in this practice with other borrowers Shellpoint can not foreclose based on fabricated applications and manufactured denials.

9. SHELLPOINT VIOLATED ITS OWN WRITTEN INSTRUCTION TO MAKE PAYMENTS Timeline of Shellpoint 's contradictory conduct : XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint sends letter stating : - My alleged application grants me protection from foreclosure - I should continue to make monthly payments according to your loan agreement XX/XX/XXXX : Following Shellpoint 's written instruction, I made my regular weekly {$170.00} payment via bill pay ( as I had been doing for years ). 
XX/XX/XXXX : Shellpoint REJECTED/RETURNED my XX/XX/XXXX payment.

This means : 1. Shellpoint instructed me in writing to make payments ( XX/XX/XXXX ) 2. I made a payment in direct reliance on that instruction ( XX/XX/XXXX ) 3. Shellpoint rejected the payment I made following their instruction ( XX/XX/XXXX ) 4. This occurred during the alleged 'evaluation period ' when foreclosure protection supposedly applied Shellpoint can not : - Tell me to make payments in writing - Reject payments I make following those instructions - Use rejected payments to justify foreclosure - Claim I'm not paying when they won't accept payments The 5-day gap between payment submission ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and rejection ( XX/XX/XXXX ) proves this was a deliberate, affirmative decision by Shellpoint to reject my payment during the evaluation period.

This demonstrates : - The evaluation was a sham with predetermined denial - Payment rejection was part of scheme to increase arrears- Shellpoint 's bad faith in servicing my account This XX/XX/XXXX payment was part of my consistent pattern of weekly payments I had been making for years. I was continuing my established payment schedule in compliance with both my XX/XX/XXXX modification and Shellpoint 's XX/XX/XXXX written instruction.

Shellpoint 's rejection of this payment - made in direct response to their written directive - is evidence of bad faith, breach of their own instructions, and advancement of foreclosure during a supposed evaluation period.

10. SHELLPOINT FAILED TO ADDRESS CRITICAL PAYMENT INFORMATION My complaint specifically detailed the payments I made, which Shellpoint completely ignored : I MAKE WEEKLY PAYMENTS I make payments of {$170.00} per week ( not monthly ), which equals MORE than the required {$660.00} monthly payment.

Looking at Shellpoint 's loan history statement : - Multiple {$170.00} entries per month clearly show weekly payment pattern - I was CONSISTENTLY OVERPAYING the required amount - Yet principal balance remained flat at around {$110000.00} for 20+ months This proves Shellpoint could not properly handle weekly payments and failed to : 1. Apply the extra to principal 2. Properly credit weekly payments as they were received 3. Notify me if weekly payments caused processing issues I was paying EXTRA to reduce my debt faster. Shellpoint 's system failure in handling weekly payments should not result in foreclosure.

TOTAL PAYMENTS MADE SINCE MODIFICATION ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) : My post-modification principal balance was {$110000.00}, which included all arrears, fees, and advances up to that date I paid {$16000.00} of the required down payments of {$15000.00} ( {$930.00} over required ) I paid payments totaling {$10000.00} between XXXX and when Shellpoint improperly stopped accepting payments.

The bankruptcy trustee made additional payments totaling {$7600.00} ( XXXX ) I resumed weekly payments on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$4600.00} up until Shellpoint improperly stopped accepting payments.

TOTAL PAYMENTS : {$39000.00} According to modification, these are the facts, REQUIRED PAYMENTS : Down payment : {$15000.00} Monthly payments ( 42 months {$660.00} ) : {$28000.00} TOTAL REQUIRED : {$43000.00} ACTUAL SHORTFALL, including months of rejected payments ( if all payments properly applied ) : Approximately {$4400.00} This represents approximately 6-7 months of payments - a manageable amount that I should have been given clear opportunity to cure.

Instead, Shellpoint : Claims I am delinquent from XX/XX/XXXX Has not explained where my {$39000.00} in payments went Refuses to provide an accurate accounting Rejects my attempts to continue making payments I have paid {$39000.00} in good faith to perform under the modification. Shellpoint 's failure to properly apply these payments created the alleged delinquency.

11. ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN SHELLPOINT 'S RESPONSE ( a ) Harassment from Third-Party Solicitors Since the Notice of Default was filed on XX/XX/XXXX, multiple third-party solicitors have been calling my adult children regarding this debt. These unsolicited calls have caused additional stress and embarrassment to my family. While Shellpoint may not be directly making these calls, the filing of the NOD made my personal financial situation public record, leading to this harassment.

( b ) Documented Emotional Distress and Harassment The stress from Shellpoint 's conduct has caused severe documented harm : Emergency room visit for XXXX XXXX ( thought I was having a XXXX XXXX ) Ongoing physical symptoms including chest pains and ulcer-like symptoms Constant phone calls, mail, and door knocking Public humiliation from foreclosure notice posted on XXXX Harassment of my children Shellpoint 's response shows no acknowledgment of the harm their admitted errors have caused.

( c ) California Homeowner Bill of Rights Violations If Shellpoint questions whether California HBOR applies to HELOCs, California Civil Code 2924.12 ( d ) states protections apply to "" any entity that seeks to foreclose on a mortgage or deed of trust '' on residential property. My HELOC is secured by my primary residence and therefore protected.

Shellpoint has violated : Accurate information requirements Good faith servicing obligations Dual tracking prohibitions 12. SHELLPOINT 'S PROPOSED "" RESOLUTION '' IS INADEQUATE AND UNACCEPTABLE Shellpoint 's XX/XX/XXXX letter states they "" waived legal and foreclosure-related fees totaling {$2500.00} '' with only a {$25.00} NSF fee remaining.

This is inadequate because : It does not correct the underlying accounting errors they admitted It does not explain where my {$39000.00} in payments were applied It does not credit my {$930.00} down payment overpayment It does not provide the accurate principal balance It does not rescind the wrongfully-filed Notice of Default It does not address their payment rejection pattern It does not resolve the 13-year draw period error 's impact Waiving fees they should never have charged in the first place does not resolve systematic accounting fraud and breach of contract.

13. SHELLPOINT 'S XX/XX/XXXX DENIAL LETTER PROVES THEY ARE NOT HONORING MY EXISTING MODIFICATION On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint sent me a letter denying me for various loss mitigation programs, stating my housing debt-to-income ratio is out of the acceptable range.

This denial reveals the core problem : 1. I already have a valid, fully executed loan modification dated XX/XX/XXXX, with monthly payments of {$660.00} on a principal balance of {$110000.00}, acknowledged by the bankruptcy court.

2. I do not need new loss mitigation - I need Shellpoint to honor the existing modification agreement they inherited from XXXX. 
3. Shellpoint evaluated me as if I have no modification, determined I don't qualify for new programs, and is now proceeding with foreclosure.

4. This constitutes breach of contract. Shellpoint can not : - Refuse to honor a valid modification agreement - Require me to re-qualify for a modification I already have - Foreclose because I don't meet criteria for NEW loss mitigation Shellpoint 's position is clear : They do not recognize my XX/XX/XXXX modification as valid and binding. This is precisely why they have been misapplying my payments and rejecting my weekly payments that exceed the required $ XXXXmonth. 
I am not seeking new loss mitigation. I am demanding Shellpoint honor the existing modification agreement I have with my lender.

14. THE ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED AND REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION At this time : My account history is still incorrect My XXXX modification has not been correctly applied My payments totaling {$39000.00} have not been properly credited My principal balance remains inconsistent and unexplained My arrears remain unverified and unexplained My rejected payments remain unexplained My draw period was misrepresented for thirteen years with no accounting correction Foreclosure proceedings continue despite unresolved servicing errors I am unable to make payments due to Shellpoint 's rejections CONCLUSION Shellpoint has admitted in writing to : Years of accounting errors ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) Misapplication of modification payments 13-year draw period configuration error ( XXXX, and even their "" correction '' to XXXX is still wrong by 5 years ) Servicing errors requiring "" corrections '' Despite these admissions, they have not corrected my account and continue to pursue foreclosure based on a delinquency THEY CREATED through their own errors.

I have paid {$39000.00} in good faith to perform under my modification agreement, making WEEKLY payments exceeding the required $ XXXX/month. I should not lose my home because Shellpoint failed to properly account for my payments.

Additionally, Shellpoint fabricated a loss mitigation application I never submitted, then rejected my payments while claiming to "" evaluate '' me, then denied the fabricated application - all while refusing to honor my valid XX/XX/XXXX modification agreement.

The issues raised in my original complaint remain completely unresolved. Shellpoint 's response does not satisfy their obligations under RESPA and does not provide the accurate accounting I am legally entitled to receive.

I respectfully request CFPB 's continued oversight of this matter, as Shellpoint 's conduct has caused severe financial and emotional hardship for me and my family.

12/27/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"Complaint Against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing I am submitting this complaint regarding serious issues I have experienced with Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing related to the handling of my mortgage loan. 

I am the authorized party for the loan listed below. 
Over the past several months, I have received inconsistent and conflicting information from Shellpoint regarding the status of this loan. I have made multiple attempts to understand my options and obtain accurate information, but the responses I received have been unclear and contradictory. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received a Notice of Default and Election to Sell by mail. This was the first formal written notice I received indicating foreclosure activity. However, before and after receiving this notice, Shellpoint representatives repeatedly told me that there was no active foreclosure, no foreclosure review in progress, and no sale-related action pending. These statements directly conflicted with the existence of the mailed Notice of Default and left me uncertain about the true status of the loan. 

In addition, there have been significant discrepancies in the reinstatement amounts I was provided. Shellpoints online portal shows that approximately {$16000.00} is past due. However, during phone calls, representatives quoted reinstatement amounts closer to {$20000.00}, without providing any written explanation or itemized breakdown. Despite requesting clarification, I have not received a written reinstatement quote or a clear explanation of the difference.

My attempts to resolve these issues have been frustrating. I have experienced disconnected calls, refusals to escalate my concerns to a supervisor, and a lack of written responses after verbal discussions and portal activity. I have not been provided with clear written determinations or consistent guidance, which has made it difficult to make informed decisions or move forward. 

I am asking for assistance to ensure this matter is handled properly. Specifically, I am requesting that Shellpoint be required to : Provide a clear, written, and itemized reinstatement amount Provide a full accounting of fees, charges, and payments applied to the loan Explain in writing the status and basis of the Notice of Default dated XX/XX/year>XXXX  Review the loan for servicing errors Pause foreclosure-related activity while these issues are reviewed Assign a single, knowledgeable point of contact I am seeking transparency, accurate information, and a fair opportunity to address the situation without further confusion or escalation caused by inconsistent servicing.

I have completed the following outreach : - Sent dozens contact messages via my portal with no response or response without answer - Twice mailed documentation and dispute letters to the Notice XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC. The first packet I sent was responded to around XXXX months later with a copy of my mortgage agreement and no specific answer to my question. 
- Called and/or spoke to representatives dozens of times, each with varying responses on how to resolve this issue. Had conversations with XXXX supervisors to resolve, most recently was advised to send a letter to the Notice XXXX XXXX department with the below language. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment of {$900.00}. This payment was intended for my September 2024 monthly mortgage obligation and was made well within the grace period. However, your system incorrectly applied this payment as a "" principal-only '' payment instead of applying it to the September 2024 monthly amount due. 

This error has caused a cascading series of problems : XXXX XXXX XXXX : Because the {$900.00} payment was not credited to my XXXX obligation, I was incorrectly charged a late fee for that month. 

XXXX XXXX : This initial error has set all subsequent payments back by XXXX month. Payments intended for XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX have likely been misapplied, creating a false delinquency. 

Inaccurate Credit Reporting : As a result of the misapplied payments, your company has very likely reported late payments to the national credit bureaus ( Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion ) for the months following XX/XX/XXXX, which is damaging my credit history and score. 

This situation is due to an internal error in how my payment was processed. The payment was made on time within my grace period and should have been applied correctly. 
Therefore, I respectfully request that you take the following actions immediately : - Remove the XXXX XXXX : Remove the late fee assessed for XX/XX/XXXX, as the payment was made within the grace period. 
- Correct Payment Application : Re-post all payments starting with the XX/XX/XXXX, payment of {$900.00} correctly, applying them to the appropriate monthly billing cycle they were intended for ( e.g., the XX/XX/XXXX payment to XX/XX/XXXX, and so on ). 
- Correct Credit Reporting : Remove any and all late payment notations that have been reported to the credit bureaus as a result of this error for the months of XX/XX/XXXX and all subsequent months.

11/13/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"CFPB COMPLAINT ( UPDATED WITH XXXX / BOARD LIABILITY ) Subject : Servicer Misrepresentations to South Carolina Attorney General ; Contradictory Account Information ; Failure to Correct Notices of Error ; Systemic Misapplication of VA Loan Payments ; Corporate-Governance Violations Under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 



Summary of the Issue My servicer ( NewRez/Shellpoint , owned and controlled by XXXX XXXX XXXX ) has issued false and contradictory account information to multiple regulators. Most recently, they supplied the South Carolina Attorney General with a letter that contradicts : their own recorded phone calls, multiple ledgers, screenshots of payment reversals, prior CFPB responses, documents submitted to XXXX, and VA loan servicing rules. 

This conduct violates : RESPA / Reg X 1024.35 failure to correct servicing errors RESPA / Reg X 1024.38 failure to maintain reasonable servicing policies Dodd-Frank UDAAP ( 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ) VA Servicer Handbook M26-4 38 C.F.R. 36.4300 et seq. 

Further, because NewRez and XXXX are Delaware corporations, this pattern constitutes a XXXX oversight failure under : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

This is a textbook case of failure to implement or monitor a system of controls, resulting in systemic misrepresentations to regulators and the borrower. 



Detailed Description 1. Contradictory Letter to SC Attorney General On receipt of a new letter sent by the servicer to the South Carolina AG, I identified blatant inconsistencies compared to : ledgers showing {$12000.00} unapplied ( recorded call on XX/XX/XXXX ), a ledger showing {$750.00} added then removed, previous statements claiming XXXX was paid, screenshots showing payments applied removed re-applied, earlier written assurances of error but without correction. 

The AG letter was not just inaccurateit contradicted evidence the AG already received from me.

Issuing false information to a regulator violates 12 C.F.R. 1024.38.

2. Repeated Failure to Correct a Notice of Error ( RESPA 1024.35 ) I sent multiple Notices of Error, including XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, documenting : unapplied payments, mismatched balances, reversals without justification, improper suspense activity. 

Under Reg X 1024.35 ( e ) the servicer must correct or reasonably investigate.

They did neither.

Instead, they issued contradictory letters such as the one sent to SCAG. 



XXXX. Pattern of Misrepresentation Across Regulators The servicer has now issued different balances to : me ( borrower ) CFPB XXXX SC Attorney General These discrepancies are material, recurring, and inconsistent with federal requirements. 

This pattern of contradictory reporting meets the criteria for : UDAAP deception, RESPA systemic policy failure, and Delaware fiduciary-duty failure under XXXX. 



4. VA Loan Servicing Violations This is a VA-guaranteed loan, which imposes additional federal obligations : Accuracy of account information ( XXXX ) Proper application of payments Immediate correction of servicing errors Protection from improper default reporting None of these obligations were met. 



XXXX. Corporate Governance Violations ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) NewRez and XXXX are Delaware corporations, governed by a duty to implement and monitor systems preventing illegal activity. Delaware law clearly states : Directors/officers must ensure information-reporting systems exist ( XXXX ). 
Lack of oversight that allows repeated legal violations is a breach ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). 
When a company operates in a mission-critical regulatory environment ( like mortgage servicing ), oversight failures are actionable ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) XXXX 
Patterns of consumer-harm misconduct indicate failure to implement or monitor controls ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

NewRezs and XXXX leadership, directors, risk officers, and legal officers are responsible for this systemic breakdown. 



XXXX. Specific Leadership with Oversight Responsibility NewRez XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ultimate operational oversight XXXX XXXX ( Head of Servicing ) responsible for servicing accuracy XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) administrative controls XXXX XXXX ( Chief XXXX & XXXX XXXX ) legal compliance and risk XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) financial accuracy and ledgers XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) system controls and data integrity NewRez XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Parent Company ) XXXX XXXX ( CEO/Chairman ) ultimate fiduciary oversight XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) responsible for accounting controls XXXX XXXX ( Chief XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Each of these individuals is accountable under XXXX for ensuring : accurate reporting systems, lawful servicing practices, protection of borrowers under RESPA and federal law XXXX 

Their failure to prevent or correct systemic inconsistencies violates Delaware fiduciary-duty precedents. 



XXXX. Harm Suffered Because of these failures I have suffered : inability to determine lawful amount due threats of foreclosure based on false balances emotional/psychological distress financial uncertainty the impossibility of maintaining payment compliance inaccurate reporting across multiple regulators Requested CFPB Actions I request that the CFPB : XXXX. Require a full, corrected loan history from Day XXXX ( all suspense, escrow, reversals ). 
XXXX. Investigate the false statements made to the SC Attorney General. 
XXXX. Enforce corrective action for violations of Reg X 1024.35 and 1024.38. 
XXXX. Review UDAAP violations for deceptive reporting. 
XXXX. Examine whether NewRez/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX oversight duties given the systemic nature of these contradictions. 
XXXX. Freeze foreclosure activity until a fully accurate accounting is produced. 
XXXX. Open supervisory review into whether this reflects a systemic VA-loan servicing pattern. 
ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH ( PLACE AFTER Harm Suffered ) I can not lawfully determine when my payment is due or how much I am supposed to pay, because the servicer has issued multiple conflicting balances, contradictory ledgers, inconsistent explanations, and reversals that do not match their own recorded calls or prior statements. These discrepancies directly interfere with my ability to comply with my VA-guaranteed mortgage obligations. Under RESPA/Reg X and VA servicing rules, a servicer must maintain accurate, consistent, and reliable account information. I can not continue throwing money into a system where payments disappear, are reclassified, removed, reapplied, or contradicted across regulators. Until I receive a fully accurate, corrected, and reconciled ledger, it is legally impossible for me to make proper payments, and the servicer can not threaten foreclosure based on information they themselves can not keep consistent. It is their duty, not mine, to maintain accurate records and respond truthfully.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17210174

I can not rebuild or place the replacement home until these funds are released, and the servicer is adding unauthorized conditions each time I comply with their prior requests. 

What Happened : My home was declared a total loss due to flooding. 

Insurance issued a loss draft made payable to me and the mortgage company. 

I submitted all required claim documentation. 

I provided the location of the replacement home on higher ground as USDA requires. 

I provided access and approval for any necessary inspections. 

Despite meeting all requirements, the servicer refuses to release the funds and is engaging in the following unlawful behavior : XXXX. Adding moving target conditions not in my mortgage contract They have repeatedly created NEW, unauthorized requirements such as : Demanding that the old home be fully cleared and leveled before releasing insurance funds Demanding personal financial information ( bank statements, proof of cash reserves, income verification ) Demanding proof of how I will pay any difference in cost between old and new home Requiring site clearing before funds are disbursed, which is impossible since funds are needed to complete demolition and setup None of these demands exist in my mortgage, security instrument, USDA regulations, or loss draft agreements. 

XXXX. Violations of RESPA ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ) They are : Creating unreasonable delays Continuously adding new conditions Engaging in bad-faith servicing practices Withholding insurance funds without legal basis XXXX. Violations of USDA Servicer Requirements ( Handbook XXXX Chapter XXXX ) Under USDA loss draft rules, servicers may : Verify damage Confirm replacement/repair Inspect the property They may NOT : Demand personal financial disclosures Require demolition prior to funds release Withhold funds because the borrower declines to provide bank statements Invent new conditions after a file is complete 4. Financial Harm The servicers delay has prevented me from : Placing the replacement home Removing the destroyed structure Restoring the property for safe habitation Beginning construction Rebuilding after a federally recognized disaster XXXX.

The property faces an irreversible foreclosure deadline of XX/XX/year>. This date marks the expiration of the reinstatement quote and is only 21 days away. 
I. OBSTRUCTION DIRECTLY CAUSING FORECLOSURE RISK My inability to pay the mortgage and satisfy the {$5500.00} reinstatement quote is directly caused by documented, systemic family obstruction. 
The "" Fake XXXX '' Obstruction : Family members admitted on XX/XX/year>, that they substituted a decoy phone for the decedent 's authentic device. 
Foreclosure Causation : The authentic device contains two-factor authentication ( XXXX ) codes necessary to access the bank accounts holding the funds required to cure the default. I sent a certified mail demand for the device and other assets on XX/XX/year>, but obstruction has continued for over 166 days. 
Irreparable Harm : The property, valued at {$1.00} XXXX with over {$400000.00} in net equity, faces permanent and irreversible loss if the XX/XX/XXXX deadline is missed. 
XXXX. SERVICER FAILURE TO RESOLVE SUCCESSOR-IN-INTEREST ( SII ) STATUS Despite my continuous good faith efforts and submission of documents starting in XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint has failed to formally recognize me as the Successor-in-Interest ( SII ). 
The servicer issued the XX/XX/XXXX deadline knowing the SII determination was incomplete and that I was unable to access the funds due to the documented obstruction. 
This failure to acknowledge my role and resolve the status is a violation of federal mortgage servicing regulations. 
XXXX. BAD FAITH EVIDENCE This obstruction is connected to a clear pattern of bad faith conduct. 
On XX/XX/year>, an attorney representing XXXX of the adverse parties admitted, via letter, to the unauthorized sale of a Trust vehicle. 
The proceeds of the sale, {$10000.00}, were deposited into a non-beneficiary 's personal account ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), exposing the Trust to further asset dissipation. 
I have exhausted all reasonable self-help efforts. I am filing a related PC XXXX petition in Superior Court this week to compel the return of the authentic device and funds. 
I request the CFPB immediately investigate Shellpoint 's regulatory violation regarding the SII determination and use its authority to demand Shellpoint grant a 60-day forbearance extension on the XX/XX/XXXX deadline to allow the court proceedings to resolve the obstruction.

Additionally, I was not properly notified by letter of the denial until I proactively called to check on the status in XXXX, despite being informed that the denial occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. The online status also still shows my modification as "" in review, '' which further complicates matters. 

Key Details : Application for Modification : I applied for mortgage assistance on XX/XX/XXXX, and I followed up with a call on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my application had been received. 

Document Submission : I submitted all requested documents promptly, but Shellpoint repeatedly asked for the same documents, which led to unnecessary delays in processing my request. 

Denial Notification : I was not notified of the denial of my modification by letter. It wasn't until I called to check on the status in XXXX that I was informed that my modification had been denied on XX/XX/XXXX due to the Net Present Value ( NPV ) test. Despite several requests, Shellpoint has not provided a detailed breakdown of the NPV calculation, including the input and output information used to determine the denial. 

Foreclosure Court : Although foreclosure proceedings were supposedly placed on hold during the modification review process, I was still required to attend foreclosure court. This was both stressful and confusing, as I had been led to believe that foreclosure actions would be suspended while my modification application was under review. 

Online Status Inconsistency : Despite being told that my modification was denied, the online portal still shows my status as "" in review. '' This inconsistency has added to my frustration and confusion, leaving me unsure of whether the case is truly closed or if further action is required. 

Repeated Calls and Inadequate Assistance : On several occasions, I reached out to Shellpoint for updates, but each representative seemed either unaware of my case or unable to provide meaningful help. This lack of continuity and communication has prolonged the process and caused unnecessary stress. 


Given the lack of communication and the inconsistent information provided, I believe that Shellpoints handling of my case has been both inefficient and frustrating. I am requesting the following resolutions : 1. Clarification and Transparency : I request a full breakdown of the NPV calculation, including all input and output data used in the denial of my modification request. 


2. Proper Review of My Case : I ask that Shellpoint review my case comprehensively, ensuring all documentation is considered, and provide clear communication regarding the status of my application.

3. Address Foreclosure Court Proceedings : I request that Shellpoint explain why foreclosure court proceedings were initiated despite being informed that they would be on hold during the review process.

4. Resolve Online Status Discrepancy : I request that Shellpoint update the online portal to accurately reflect the current status of my modification request. 


5. Accountability for Poor Service : I ask that Shellpoint be held accountable for the delays, lack of transparency, and poor customer service throughout this process. 



I hope that the CFPB can assist in resolving this matter promptly and help ensure that Shellpoint provides a fair and transparent resolution to my situation.

Duplicate Withdrawal of {$840.00} I did not know that my online account had already been activated, and Shellpoint automatically withdrew $ XXXXfrom my bank account on XX/XX/year>.

Everytime I call and ask they say your insurance premium went up. I get cheaper insurance and it still goes up. Now it's my property value went up. Every year since I got the mortgage my payment has gone up. My recent issue is that I received a homestead exemption earlier this year that was backdated for XXXX years. I did not even know anything about a homestead exemption until last year. XXXX XXXX stated they completed my exemption and gave New Rez the information, this was back in XXXX or XXXX of this year. New Rez never applied my exemption which caused me to be overpaying about XXXX for XXXX  months until XXXX when I called to find out again why my tax bill was so high. They state they never got my homestead exemption documents, but the county and tax accessory office state they did give my updated information and they see the escrow account and they have been sending my tax bill and info to New Rez. So why all of a sudden they did not get my exemptions, but they have been getting my tax bill every year. My escrow account is sitting over XXXX  plus right now and I don't have an insurance payment until XXXX of next year. That will put my escrow account well over XXXX but they are still saying I have a XXXX shortage. New Rez is over charging for my escrow payments. Over XXXX of my payment goes into escrow but I'm still short. I have requested to be refunded my overpayment due to them not doing my analysis at the beginning of the year and waiting until XXXX. They say the overpayment went into my escrow to cover my shortage. I asked why then is it showing on my account I'm expecting to have a shortage of XXXX.

The call ended with the supervisor saying well you have to have a cushion so that's why you have a shortage. My escrow account is sitting at over XXXX  how am I short. They are gouging people and taking their hard earned money. It seems as if they are purposely raising the payment every year so people can't afford to pay and loose their home. It's not right.

01/11/26,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"To Whom It May Concern, I am submitting this complaint regarding a late payment reported on my mortgage account that I believe was unfair and caused significant, unexpected damage to my credit. 

Due to a temporary financial hardship, I proactively contacted my mortgage servicer in XX/XX/2025 to set up a payment plan to catch up on two missed months. This plan was set up verbally over the phone, and no written agreement or disclosure was provided to me regarding the timing or potential impact on my credit. 

At no point was I informed that the scheduled payment date under this plan would still fall past the reporting threshold and be reported as late to the credit bureaus. Had I been made aware, I would have paid 1-4 days earlier to prevent any negative impact. 

Despite following the plan as instructed, I received a notification on XX/XX/2025, that my credit score dropped almost 40 points due to this reported late payment. I have been contacting the servicer and speaking with customer service agents for six months, trying to resolve this issue. Only in XX/XX/2025 was I finally told that they can not accept credit disputes online and that I must submit them via mail, even though I have been calling every week or couple weeks since XXXX and none of the representatives ever told me that. 

When I disputed this directly with the servicer, they stated the payment was reported accurately and refused to take corrective action, without addressing the lack of disclosure or explanation regarding the credit impact. 

I am requesting : A review of the call records or servicing notes from the payment plan setup Consideration of a goodwill adjustment to remove the reported late payment Improved disclosure practices for borrowers entering payment plans Recognition of the prolonged difficulty and poor communication I experienced over the past six months Thank you for your attention to this matter.

11/15/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Issue : Conflicting Corporate Addresses & Identities NewRez / Shellpoint / Rithm I am a XXXX veteran with a XXXX-backed mortgage serviced under the NewRez / Shellpoint / Rithm platform. Even at the most basic level Where is my servicer actually located and who is responsible? I can not get a consistent answer. 

A. Evidence of conflicting addresses and identities XXXX. Shellpoint envelope addressed to me I received physical mail from Shellpoint showing : Shellpoint, XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Addressed to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX XXXX. BBB XXXX for NewRez LLC The Better Business Bureau entry for NewRez LLC shows : Local office : XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX Additional info for headquarters : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX. 
XXXX. Public corporate information / search results for NewRez Public corporate information describes NewRez as having : Headquarters at XXXX Office XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Washington, PA, Corporate location at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, PA, and Correspondence / error-resolution address as P.O. Box XXXX, XXXX, SC XXXX. 
The same information identifies XXXX XXXX as the parent company of NewRez. 
XXXX. Shellpoint vs. NewRez branding My loan has been handled under both Shellpoint and NewRez branding, with different addresses attached to each name, while XXXX own public disclosures describe NewRez as a subsidiary and integrate servicer revenues into XXXX business. 

As a borrower, I am facing : Multiple different headquarters across XXXX Washington, PA ; XXXX XXXX, PA ; XXXX, NC ; Different correspondence or error resolution P.O. Boxes in XXXX, SC and XXXX XXXX, FL ; and XXXX different operating names ( NewRez and Shellpoint ), plus a parent ( XXXX XXXX ) that profits from this platform while disowning it in CFPB responses. 

This is not a minor clerical inconsistency. The system is designed so I can never be sure which address, which name, or which entity is legally responsible for fixing my account. 



How this violates federal law and compromises the system I believe this conduct violates, at a minimum : XXXX. RESPA & XXXX XXXX ( XXXX U.S.C. XXXX ; XXXX C.F.R. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) Servicers must clearly designate where borrowers send Notices of Error ( NOEs ) and Requests for XXXX ( RFIs ) and must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure proper handling. 
Maintaining multiple, conflicting error resolution, correspondence, and headquarters addresses under different brand names ( NewRez, Shellpoint ) makes it unreasonably difficult for me to know where to send NOEs/RFIs and gives the servicer an excuse to claim it did not receive them or that they were sent to the wrong location. 
This defeats the core purpose of XXXX XXXX, which is to give borrowers a clear, working channel to dispute errors and demand corrections before delinquency and foreclosure occur. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX provisions ( Dodd-Frank Act XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX U.S.C. XXXX, XXXX ) Presenting different addresses and corporate identities to different audiences is deceptive and abusive : To borrowers, I see a confusing shell-game of NewRez vs. Shellpoint vs. P.O. Boxes in several states. 
To investors and the SEC, XXXX presents NewRez/Shellpoint as an integrated, centrally-controlled platform generating consolidated revenue. 
This discrepancy is a classic UDAAP : it materially interferes with my ability to understand who my servicer is, where to send legal notices, and how to exercise my rights, while the parent and investors continue to enjoy the cash flows. 
XXXX. FDCPA ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX et seq. ), to the extent Shellpoint/NewRez act as debt XXXX If Shellpoint / NewRez qualify as debt XXXX, they must not use false, deceptive, or misleading representations, including the false representation of the character or legal status of any debt or use of any business, company, or organization name other than the true name of the debt XXXX business. 
XXXX between NewRez and Shellpoint names and addresses, while failing to clearly identify the true entity responsible for servicing and error resolution, risks violating FDCPA sections on misrepresentations and unfair practices. 
XXXX. State unfair and deceptive acts and practices ( UDAP ) statutes & mortgage-servicing laws Every state, including Tennessee, South Carolina XXXX North Carolina XXXX Pennsylvania, and Florida, has UDAP statutes that prohibit confusing, deceptive, or unfair servicing practices. 
Using multiple conflicting addresses and corporate personas to handle XXXX XXXX mortgage is unfair and deceptive because it obstructs my ability, and the ability of any reasonable consumer, to assert rights, cure errors, or prevent wrongful foreclosure. 
XXXX. SEC / securities-law integrity ( connection to XXXX ) Public information and Rithms own XXXX identify NewRez as a subsidiary of XXXX XXXX and XXXX the mortgage-servicing platform as part of Rithms consolidated business that XXXX equity, preferred shares, and XXXX compensation. 
This makes the address and identity chaos not just a consumer-protection problem but a system-level control problem : XXXX tells investors it XXXX and controls NewRez/Shellpoint and relies on XXXX XXXX XXXX flows. 
At the same time, the platform uses a maze of addresses and brands that prevent borrowers from effectively reaching the true responsible entity, undermining the integrity of the servicing operations that back the securities. 



Systemic impact & risk This is not just my confusion. If I, as a XXXX veteran with a XXXX loan, can not determine : which legal entity services my loan, which address will actually process a Notice of XXXX, and which company is accountable for corrupted ledgers and foreclosure threats, then every other borrower in this platform faces the same structural trap. 

The multiple headquarters and correspondence addresses show : A servicing system spread across several states and brands, A parent company ( Rithm ) that profits from the system but has allowed this fragmented address structure to persist, and A built-in defense : any time a borrower sends a compliant notice, the company can argue it was mailed to the wrong address or entity. 

This undermines : The entire XXXX XXXX XXXX for error resolution, State UDAP enforcement, and The reliability of the servicing platform that XXXX uses to support registered securities and insider compensation. 



Requested CFPB action ( address-focused ) XXXX. Require NewRez / Shellpoint / Rithm to : Designate and publicly disclose XXXX clear, uniform address for RESPA Notices of Error and Requests for Information for my loan, Confirm in writing which legal entity is responsible for servicing my loan and for correcting ledger errors, and Align all correspondence, billing, and collection letters to that single servicing identity and address. 
XXXX. Investigate whether the use of multiple addresses and trade names constitutes : A XXXX X violation ( failure to maintain reasonable policies and procedures for error resolution ), A UDAAP under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, and A violation of any applicable state UDAP or mortgage-servicing laws. 
XXXX. Coordinate, as appropriate, with : State regulators in TN, SC, NC, PA, FL, and any other states implicated by these addresses, and The SEC, regarding whether Rithms public representations about owning and controlling its servicing platforms are consistent with the fragmented and confusing address structure presented to borrowers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/15/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17275340

11/02/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"COMPLAINT TO THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU - CONTINUATION OF CFPB CASE NO. XXXX Borrower : XXXX XXXX Lender/Servicer : NewRez LLC Mortgage account XXXX XXXX XXXX Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Violation of RESPA 6 / 12 CFR 1024.35 ( Error Resolution ) and TILA 129G / 12 CFR 1026.36 ( c ) ( Prompt Payment Crediting ) due to Servicer 's Rescission of a Prior Written Resolution and Failure to Implement Agreed-Upon Bi-Weekly Payment Crediting.

1. Introduction & Pattern of Conduct I am filing this follow-up complaint regarding NewRez 's failure to resolve a servicing error and its subsequent rescission of a written resolution, which constitutes a new and separate violation.

A pattern is evident in NewRez 's servicing. When I correspond directly, responses are delayed with repeated requests for "" more time '' ( e.g., Letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/year> ). However, upon the filing of my initial CFPB complaint on XX/XX/year>, NewRez produced a detailed response by XX/XX/year>. This demonstrates that prompt resolution is possible, yet is only undertaken under regulatory oversight. 

2. Summary of the Issue On XX/XX/year>, NewRez provided a written resolution ( Exhibit 13 ) to my Notice of Error, agreeing to : 1. Retroactively apply my bi-weekly payments effective the date funds were received.

2. Mail me a custom bi-weekly amortization schedule within 10 business days. 

NewRez never fulfilled the amortization schedule promise. 

In its XX/XX/year>, response to CFPB ( Exhibit 16 ), NewRez unilaterally rescinded the agreement, citing "" system limitations '' and apologizing for "" misinformation. '' With the response I received on XX/XX/year>, NewRez showed two flaws : 1. A servicer can not resolve an error in writing and then, weeks later, simply declare that resolution "" erroneous '' without violating RESPA 's error-resolution procedures. 

3. Chronology of Facts & Legal Violations : XXXX. XX/XX/year> ( Exhibit 06 ) : I submitted a written request for a true bi-weekly payment plan, where each half-payment is credited upon receipt as required by TILA ( 12 CFR 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( i ) ).

3.2. XX/XX/year> ( Exhibit 08 ) : After NewRez 's initial non responsive reply, I sent a follow-up that constituted a formal Notice of Error ( NOE ) under RESPA ( 12 CFR 1024.35 ), specifically citing : 3.2.1 Failure to apply an accepted payment as agreed.

3.2.2 Failure to credit a payment as of the date of receipt. 

3.3. XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit 10, 11, 12 ) : NewRez sent me several letters delaying my requesting, "" more time '' to respond. 

3.4. XX/XX/year> ( Exhibit 13 ) : NewRez acknowledged the error and provided a written resolution, agreeing to my requested crediting method and promising a custom amortization schedule. This letter created a binding commitment. 

3.5. XX/XX/year> ( Exhibit 14 ) : Due to NewRez 's delay in providing the promised amortization schedule, I sent a written reminder, indicating that I will send my complaint to the CFPB. 

3.6. XX/XX/year> ( Exhibit 15 ) : NewRez continued sending me delay letter. 

3.7. XX/XX/year> ( Exhibit 16 ) : NewRez responded through CFPB breached its agreement, stating it could not honor the XX/XX/XXXX resolution and reaffirming its non compliant practice of holding partial payments in suspense. 

4. Legal Analysis : NewRez Violated RESPA 's Error-Resolution Procedures ( 12 CFR 1024.35 ) 4.1. A servicer must respond to an NOE within a specified timeframe. NewRez 's serial "" more time '' letters, followed by a definitive resolution ( Exhibit 13 ) and subsequent retraction ( Exhibit 16 ), demonstrates a failure to conduct a reasonable investigation and provide a final, accurate response. A resolved error can not be "" un-resolved '' without triggering a new violation.

4.2. NewRez Violated TILA 's Prompt Crediting Rule ( 12 CFR 1026.36 ( c ) ) : The law is clear : "" A servicer shall credit a periodic payment to the consumer 's loan account as of the date of receipt. '' NewRez 's policy of holding the first half payment in a suspense account ( as admitted in its ACH form, Exhibit 18 ) is a direct violation. 
"" System limitations '' are not a legal defense. Servicers are required to maintain systems that comply with federal law. NewRez 's inability to generate a bi-weekly amortization schedule is an admission that its system is not configured to comply with the prompt crediting rule, which is itself a non compliance with the regulations.

4.3. The Amortization Schedule is Essential for Verification and Transparency The promised amortization schedule is not a mere courtesy ; it is the controlling math that operationalizes the agreed crediting method and enables audit against statements and payoff quotes ( which must be provided within 7 business days upon written request ). ( 15 U.S.C. 1639g. ) It is the necessary tool to verify that NewRez is complying with the law and its own agreement.Without it, I can not confirm that NewRez is applying as of receipt ( or properly retro applying component halves to their receipt dates once the monthly threshold is met ). The missing schedule is the core gap that forces ongoing disputes.",Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",PA,180XX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/02/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16976013

1. The Core Error : Our legal names were changed from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX by a court order ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XXXX This change was finalized years before this mortgage was originated. We have provided Shellpoint with a copy of the official court decree and our U.S. Passports, which all confirm our legal names are XXXX. Despite this irrefutable evidence, Shellpoint 's systems only recognize our former, invalid names. 

XXXX. The Impact and Violation : This is not a minor error. Shellpoint 's failure to update our records has severe consequences : Refusal to Communicate : When I, XXXX XXXX, call and identify myself by my legal name, Shellpoint representatives refuse to speak to me or provide any information about our loan ( number XXXX ). They will only engage if I falsely use my former name, XXXX. This is a direct refusal to provide service to the account holders. 

Blocked Access : We are systematically denied access to information about our own loan and can not conduct necessary business unless we misrepresent our identities. This is a fundamental violation of our rights as consumers. 

XXXX. The Expanded Risk : This error is not contained within Shellpoint. We are aware that other entities are involved, including XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Because Shellpoint has not corrected its internal records, it is certain that these inaccurate details ( our former names ) are being communicated to these other parties. This creates a significant risk of improper communications, faulty legal documents, and a fundamental breach of our privacy throughout the entire loan ecosystem. 

XXXX. Desired Resolution : We demand that Shellpoint immediately : Update its primary records to reflect our legal names, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

Provide written confirmation that this change has been completed. 

Identify and coordinate with all other entities involved in the servicing, ownership, or legal proceedings of this loanspecifically XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXXto ensure they immediately receive corrected, accurate information about the borrowers ' legal identities. 

Ensure all future communications from Shellpoint and its partners are addressed to our correct legal names. 

Train its staff to handle legal name changes appropriately and to never refuse service to an account holder who provides their correct legal name. 

This is a serious failure to maintain accurate records as required by consumer financial protection laws. Shellpoint 's continued inaction, despite multiple notifications, is unacceptable and has left us with no other recourse. 

We have attached the official court decree and U.S. Passports as definitive proof. We expect Shellpoint to resolve this completely, which includes fixing the information with all other involved parties.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,08/19/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15378063

They promised me that it would not effect my credit. They put me on a deferment option that put the three payments at the end of my mortgage. XXXX XXXX had previously, about a year before done the same for a one-year deferment that did not effect my credit whatsoever. Now I have been fighting for almost three years with NewRez to fix.

10/09/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Supplemental to complaint number XXXX Subject : Misapplication of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inflated Escrow Payments, and Failure to Correct Billing Errors This Notice of Error is submitted pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 to identify and request correction of multiple servicing errors originating with XXXX XXXX and continued by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. These errors concern the handling of state assistance funds from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), misapplied escrow accounting, and Shellpoints failure to correct an overbilled payment amount after I repeatedly asked them to review my account. 

This complaint supplements prior communications and relates to CFPB Complaint # XXXX. 

Factual Background XXXX XXXX XXXX ( During XXXX XXXX ) : The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX approved funds to bring my loan current, covering both delinquent mortgage payments and past-due property taxes. XXXX XXXX failed to request the tax portion of the approved funds. Consequently, XXXX sent only the mortgage-payment portion. XXXX applied those funds solely toward mortgage principal and interest, leaving property taxes unpaid. XXXX then advanced its own funds to pay those past-due property taxes taxes that should have been covered by XXXX and created a false escrow shortage. This caused my monthly payment to increase from approximately {$2800.00} to {$3000.00}, even though the underlying property-tax obligation itself had not increased. The shortage resulted solely from XXXX mismanagement and failure to request the appropriate assistance funds. 

Second XXXX XXXX ( Also During XXXX XXXX  ) : A later round of XXXX funds included both mortgage and tax components. This assistance brought my account fully current and paid all past-due property taxes in full. The relief briefly decreased my mortgage payment ; however, XXXX XXXX never reconciled or corrected the false shortage created during the first assistance round. As a result, the account continued to reflect an inflated escrow balance, even though all property taxes had been paid after the second round of assistance. A scheduled adjustable-rate increase later raised the payment slightly, but the underlying overcollection from the earlier shortage remained embedded in the account. 

Transfer to Shellpoint ( XX/XX/year> ) : When Shellpoint took over servicing, it imported XXXX XXXX inflated escrow balance and continued billing me {$3000.00} per month. I made multiple verbal requests by phone asking Shellpoint to perform its own escrow analysis, as I believed the payment amount was incorrect. Shellpoint representatives repeatedly said they were not required to conduct a new analysis until their next scheduled cycle. Despite my repeated requests, Shellpoint refused to perform an updated analysis until XX/XX/year>. This demonstrates a lack of reasonable diligence, contrary to 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( a ) and ( e ) ( 1 ) ( i ).

Shellpoints Escrow Analysis ( XX/XX/year> ) : Shellpoints analysis dated XX/XX/year>, determined that my correct monthly payment should have been {$2800.00}, effective XX/XX/year>. This reflects my true contractual obligation for principal, interest, and property taxes. My account does not include insurance escrow. The same analysis revealed a separate {$3600.00} surplus in my escrow account, confirming that it had been overfunded for months prior. While Shellpoint may not have initially known of XXXX error, its own analysis confirmed the correct payment amount. At that point, Shellpoint had knowledge of the miscalculation but failed to retroactively correct prior billing discrepancies or refund the surplus, in violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.17 ( f ) ( 2 ).

Errors Requiring Correction Failure to properly apply state-provided assistance funds, in violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( XXXX ). 

Failure to reconcile the escrow account after the second XXXX assistance when all past-due property taxes had been fully paid. 

Failure to refund or credit surplus escrow funds, in violation of XXXX ( f ) ( XXXX ). 

Continuation of a fabricated escrow shortage, resulting in inflated monthly payments. 

Failure to act with reasonable diligence in response to multiple borrower requests. 

Failure to adjust the billed payment from {$3000.00} to {$2800.00} after confirming the corrected amount. 

Requested Resolution Please : Audit my account from the first XXXX assistance forward. 

Remove all false escrow shortages created from misapplied funds. 

Retroactively correct my payment to {$2800.00} from the earliest date the miscalculation began, which predates Shellpoints onboarding. While Shellpoint may not have initially known of the miscalculation, its XX/XX/year> escrow analysis confirmed the true payment amount. From that point forward, Shellpoint had knowledge of the error but failed to correct prior overbilling. Refund or credit the difference between {$3000.00} and {$2800.00} for all affected months. 

Apply credits for overbilling before and after XX/XX/year>. 

Apply or refund the {$3600.00} escrow surplus. 

Provide a full itemized accounting of all XXXX funds and escrow disbursements. 

Confirm corrected balances in writing within XXXX business days, per RESPA. 

As stated in my prior complaint, I continue to dispute all foreclosure-related attorney fees and legal charges assessed during periods when assistance review or account correction was pending. These charges must be audited, fully explained, and, if found improper, reversed and credited to my account.

11/30/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I have reviewed Shellpoints XX/XX/XXXX response to my previous complaint filed and I disagree that there was no error. Shellpoints own letter admits that an incorrect Social Security Number was transferred to Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) during the loan transfer process and that it was not corrected until XX/XX/XXXX. During that period, when I used their find my account tool with my SSN and ZIP code, the system pulled up another borrowers loan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) and displayed his full names, property address, loan number ending in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, mortgagee clause, and active XXXX homeowners policy, while searches under my correct name and date of birth showed no accounts found. My own loan was simultaneously linked to a different SSN. This is more than a minor transfer error ; it is a serious datasecurity and privacy breach that exposed both my identity and another familys complete mortgage and insurance profile, in violation of federal privacy and safeguard rules. Issuing a gift card for XXXX does not cure that harm, and Shellpoint has not provided any technical explanation or logs showing how my SSN was mismapped or what they have done to prevent this from happening again. 
In addition, Shellpoints description of the trial modification leaves out critical context. Their letter confirms that I was approved on XX/XX/XXXX for a threepayment trial plan at {$550.00}, and that payments were received on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Their own system showed the trial as Approved and a Shellpoint representative told me on XX/XX/XXXX that all required trial payments had been made and final modification documents would be mailed. Only after that assurance did they claim that some payments were later returned XXXX. I was never given timely written notice that any trial payment had failed, nor a clear cure period to replace it, nor an explanation of why a fourth payment of {$560.00} made on XX/XX/XXXX ( after the three required trial payments ) did not satisfy the plan. Instead, they rescinded the trial on XX/XX/XXXX and later blamed investor guidelines and delinquency, even though I continued trying to make payments and could not reach my Single Point of Contact for weeks. Shellpoints own app now shows a red banner stating this loan has a legal status preventing online payments while they continue to charge late fees, making it impossible for me to pay online but still treating nonpayment as my fault. 

I am filing this complaint against NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for a pattern of abusive and unlawful mortgageservicing practices on my homeequity loan. Shellpoint incorrectly boarded my loan with the wrong Social Security number and, for months, their online find my account tools pulled up another borrowers full mortgage and insurance information under my SSN while my own account was not findable under my correct identity. This exposed both households private financial data and created serious identitytheft and creditreporting risks. Shellpoint has admitted in writing that an incorrect SSN was transferred and corrected later, but has never explained how long the crosslink existed, how many times it was accessed, or what safeguards were implemented to prevent this from recurring. 
At the same time, Shellpoint has mishandled my payments and lossmitigation requests. They approved me for a trial modification, accepted multiple trial payments, and verbally confirmed that all required payments were received and that a permanent modification would be processed. After I relied on those assurances, they abruptly rescinded the trial plan, claimed payments were returned or the investor declined, and treated my loan as delinquent without giving me a clear cure period or a meaningful way to resolve the issue. Shellpoint has also blocked me from making online payments by flagging my loan as having a legal status preventing online payments, while still adding late fees and other defaultrelated charges. In addition, they have added inspection/BPO and other fees that appear excessive and unsupported by any change in property condition or occupancy. 

Shellpoint claimed previously that my social security was incorrect due to the previous serving company sending it at the time of transfer which Figure had sent documents stating my social being correct with their accounts and my name and said that they in fact did not send the incorrect social number with my account at transfer. Shellpoint is responsible for the mishandling of my account and personal information.

Because of these actions, my credit has been damaged, my account balance inflated by questionable fees and capitalized deferred amounts, and I have been left in constant fear of foreclosure despite actively trying to resolve the situation and make payments.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",OR,974XX,None,Consent provided,Web,11/30/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18037746

In recorded phone calls ( including XX/XX/XXXX ), Shellpoint representatives repeatedly admitted the error was theirs and promised I would not have to repay the taxes.

Shellpoint assessed legal fees on my account while my loan was current and without substantiated legal necessity. These charges were applied after all prior legal fees had been paid in full and without documentation of authorized or active legal action.

12/18/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","Summary : Newrez ( mortgage owner ) and Shellpoint Mortgage Services LLC ( servicer ) collecting and mishandling tax escrow ; escrow analysis error ( s ) ; failure to functionally or procedurally apply property tax exemption, failure to address formal Notice of Error ( NOE ). 

Imminent Financial Harm : I have remained current for all payments on my mortgage to the present date. My next automated mortgage payment, scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, continues to be scheduled at an incorrect, inflated amount of {$2600.00} which improperly includes {$140.00} tax escrow I do not owe. 

Justification for Complaint : Servicer is collecting and holding tax escrow not owed. Servicer recognizes borrower 's ( author ) permanent {$0.00} property tax obligation and confirmed permanent {$0.00} property tax obligation with the tax authority. Despite this, servicer claims escrow shortage citing tax refund processing / timing ( surplus funds ) and anticipated future taxes ( error ). Servicer verbally stated borrower must continue to pay tax escrow not owed included with Principal, Interest and Insurance, otherwise partial payment, possible default and / or other negative consequences will be levied. Servicer verbally stated this event would be "" beyond their control '' because "" their system '' does it automatically. Servicer has demonstrated apathy toward the issue and has not substantially responded to my formal NOE, under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), Regulation X, in a way outside of "" general inquiry ''. Responses received to date generally reiterate previously provided information and include the tax escrow error I am disputing. I do not have confidence the servicer will address or correct these issues without formal oversight.

XX/XX/XXXX : I provided official documentation demonstrating permanent Virginia XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After follow-up calls to customer service, Newrez / Shellpoint XXXX XXXX document and confirmed {$0.00} obligation with the tax authority XXXX XXXX tax line on the mortgage to reflect {$0.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Newrez / Shellpoint confirms taxes paid on XX/XX/XXXX and states the tax authority has confirmed the funds were disbursed by XXXX, the tax vendor. Newrez / Shellpoint confirms excess amount of {$2200.00} will be refunded. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Newrez / Shellpoint automatically drafts the full, previously scheduled mortgage payment including all property taxes, in the amount of {$2800.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Mailed Formal Notice of Error ( NOE ) notifying Owner / Servicer of tax escrow collection error. NOE provides personal identifying information, loan number, requests correction, describes error ( s ) and legal basis, as well as actions required. Borrower provided two written notices, for posterity, via online website portals, indicating mailed NOEs to both organizations. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Newrez XXXX Shellpoint conducts escrow analysis and adjusts mortgage payment to {$2600.00}. The adjusted figure includes City tax escrow. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Newrez/ Shellpoint correspondence confirms review of account to ensure "" escrow accurately reflects a {$0.00} tax obligation ''. Newrez XXXX Shellpoint confirms adjusted tax refund of {$1500.00}, with prorated {$710.00} tax for second half of XXXX. In the same correspondence, Newrez XXXX Shellpoint notes previous mortgage payment of {$2800.00} has been reduced to {$2600.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX, which still includes anticipated property tax for XXXX. Newrez XXXX Shellpoint further notes monthly payment consists of {$310.00} for escrow, and that in XX/XX/XXXX Newrez / Shellpoint anticipates City tax. Moreover, Newrez XXXX Shellpoint notes the anticipated escrow balance will be - {$480.00} due to anticipated City tax payment. 

XX/XX/XXXX : The City Treasurer 's office issued refund check to Corelogic ( tax vendor ) in the amount of {$1500.00}, check # XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX tracking, # XXXX, confirms Shellpoint received NOE on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : In a recorded call to customer service following-up with the NOE, a Newrez / Shellpoint representative named "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX regard to my NOE that "" nothing has been done and there is nothing to do because the escrow analysis is already complete. '' I explained the NOE I sent was a result of error in the escrow analysis she referenced and asked her to note the dates they'd received the NOE in my loan file because the servicer is supposed to correct the errors within XXXX working days. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received written correspondence from Newrez / Shellpoint, indicating they are responding to my "" inquiry ''. The response reiterates all previously provided information from XX/XX/XXXX and previous dates. Newrez / Shellpoint recognize my {$0.00} tax obligation, and states after a review of the account they have not identified an error in the escrow analysis. In the same correspondence, Newrez XXXX Shellpoint also reaffirm next scheduled payment of {$2600.00}, which includes payment for tax escrow ( error ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called Newrez / Shellpoint customer service to request whether or not my NOE was being treated as an NOE or a 'general inquiry ''. I did not receive an answer to this question. I also asked for the investigation / case file number in regard to the NOE investigation under way. In response to this question, the customer service representative, "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, provided a "" Task Number '', # XXXX, and elaborated no one at Newrez XXXX Shellpoint will understand what that number is if I call again and provide the task number. He stated, "" it is just a number associated to the task in the computer system. '' XXXX informed me Newrez XXXX Shellpoint has not yet received my tax refund from the City Tax authority, but when they do they will conduct a new escrow analysis. He elaborated to the effect of "" the way escrow works is that the account will show an escrow shortage until the refund is processed.

I was instructed to submit documents including a hardship letter, the Uniform Borrower Assistance Form, bank statements, explanations for deposits over {$1000.00}, and a signed IRS Form XXXX. I submitted all documents promptly. Over a XXXX review period ( XXXX XXXX ), I was assured my account would not be considered delinquent and that negative credit reporting would not occur. 

Despite this, Shellpoint denied my request after XXXX months without clear explanation, reported my account XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  days late to all three credit bureaus, and placed me on a repayment plan after misleading me into believing non-payment would not hurt my credit. These actions have damaged my credit, preventing me from refinancing my home which I am needing to do so because of the hardship I am going through still. 

Violations : - RESPA : Failure to handle loss mitigation and payment deferral requests with transparency and good faith. 
- ECOA : Failure to provide a proper written explanation for denial of credit-related assistance.

XXXX. Written explanation for denial of my deferral request despite full cooperation.

After the prior complaint was closed, Shellpoint submitted a CFPB response containing materially inaccurate and misleading statements about the timeline of foreclosure and loss-mitigation events. This complaint addresses those misrepresentations and Shellpoints continued servicing failures. 

Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing submitted a response to my prior CFPB complaint that contains material factual inaccuracies and omissions. While some dates are correct, Shellpoints response misleadingly suggests that foreclosure and loss-mitigation events occurred in XXXX, when the foreclosure activity at issue occurred in XXXX, including a foreclosure hearing scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. 

Shellpoints response omits critical facts documented in recorded phone calls, timestamped submission emails, and internal reassignment acknowledgments. These include repeated confusion over which borrower was deceased, misidentification of successor-in-interest status, incorrect filing of a standard loan modification instead of a loan-modification assumption, and internal reassignment delays that prevented underwriting review despite a complete application.

01/23/26,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"To Whom It May Concern at the CFPB, I am submitting this letter as a formal complaint and dispute regarding predatory and deceptive lending and servicing practices by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( dba Newrez LLC ), which acquired our second mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). Shellpoint is currently threatening foreclosure and issuance of a Notice of Default based on an inaccurate and disputed loan balance. 

Our original second mortgage, originated in XX/XX/XXXX, was for {$88000.00} with a 20-year maturity. We made all payments on time for the first seven years. During the housing crisis, we were advised to temporarily suspend payments on both our first and second mortgages in order to pursue a loan modification. While a modification was granted on the first mortgage, XXXX denied a modification on the second loan. 

In XXXX, XXXX threatened foreclosure. In response, on XX/XX/XXXX, we wired a lump-sum payment of {$53000.00} to bring the account current. We were explicitly advised that this payment would cover all past-due payments, late fees, and penalty fees. Since that date, we have continued to make all required payments on time. 

Despite this, Shellpoint is now demanding a payoff of {$84000.00}, claiming the loan has reached maturity. This demand is unreasonable, unsupported, and mathematically indefensible. After seven years of on-time payments, followed by a lump-sum payment exceeding {$53000.00}, and continued timely payments thereafter, Shellpoint claims that only {$3500.00} has been applied to principal. Based on these facts, this loan should be paid off or carry a minimal remaining balance, not an amount approaching the original loan value. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint has put a stop payment on the account not allowing us to make any payments. 

In addition, Shellpoint has engaged in repeated misrepresentations and servicing errors, including but not limited to : Falsely claiming to be in first lien position, when the loan is clearly a second mortgage. 
Improperly impounding our account for homeowners insurance, despite the fact that we have maintained continuous insurance coverage for over 20 years through our first mortgage servicer. 
Repeatedly disputing proof of insurance even after we have uploaded valid documentation multiple times. 
Misrepresenting that they lack our contact information, which has remained unchanged for over 20 years ( address, email addresses, and phone numbers ). 
Falsely stating that management could not return our calls for seven business days due to the law, a claim that appears to be entirely fabricated.

Failing to provide a complete and accurate accounting under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) from the loans origination in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  through the present, despite multiple requests. 
This loan has been sold and transferred multiple times since origination, yet Shellpoint has failed to provide a lawful, transparent, and complete payment history or justification for the balance they are demanding. 

Shellpoint is now threatening a Notice of Default unless we immediately pay {$84000.00}, an amount we formally dispute as inaccurate and unsupported. Their actions constitute predatory lending and servicing practices, and we believe they are attempting to collect funds that are not legally owed. 

We respectfully request the CFPBs assistance in investigating this matter and holding Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Newrez LLC ) accountable for these actions. We are seeking a full and accurate accounting, correction of the loan balance, cessation of foreclosure threats, and resolution of this matter in compliance with federal and state law.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/23/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18964757

I was given a refund of {$3500.00}, but later inform that the refund was pulled from an "" '' Escrow Disbursement '' fund, in which I had to pay back.

09/15/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"Good Morning, I am responding to Complaint ID XXXX. I have attempted multiple times to submit feedback through your online portal, but the page would not load, so I am resubmitting my concerns in writing regarding the broader issue with our escrow analysis and monthly payment increase. 

During the period when Shellpoint enforced force-placed wind coverage, our normal monthly payment was {$8300.00}. The annual force-placed insurance charges were : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$14000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX : {$4300.00} Now Shellpoint is claiming that our new monthly payment will exceed {$10000.00}, which does not make sense based on our current numbers. 

Current Loan Figures New insurance policy ( effective XX/XX/2025 ) : {$9600.00} annually Principal & Interest payment : {$4700.00} per month Current escrow payment : {$2400.00} per month ( = {$29000.00} annually ) 2025 Property Taxes : {$10000.00} Even if Shellpoint is claiming an escrow shortage and requesting an additional {$850.00} per month ( = {$10000.00} annually ), the numbers still do not align.

PITI Calculation Based on our principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, our total monthly payment should be approximately {$6300.00}, not over {$10000.00} per month.

Additional Concerns Collecting {$2400.00} per month plus {$850.00} per month equals {$39000.00} annually, which is far higher than the combined taxes and insurance required. This does not factor in credits already applied to the account fo
r XXXX and XX/XX/2025. 

The escrow account appears to still include charges for lender-placed hazard insurance, even though we have provided proof of coverage. 

Formal Request I am requesting a written explanation and a detailed escrow breakdown showing exactly how Shellpoint arrived at the new monthly payment amount, including : Itemized escrow calculation taxes, insurance, and all other components. 

Confirmation of removal of all force-placed insurance charges after XX/XX/2025. 

Calculation supporting the additional {$850.00} per month escrow collection. 

This appears to be a serious violation of escrow accounting standards, and I question how such over-collection can be allowed without proper regulatory oversight. 

On XX/XX/2025 at XXXX XXXX  Eastern, I spoke with XXXX, who confirmed the call was recorded. I strongly encourage Shellpoint leadership to review this call and use it as a training opportunity, as XXXX was unable to answer basic questions about my escrow account and monthly payment calculations. 

I have included detailed communications from my insurance agent, which clearly show that Shellpoint has failed to take responsibility for correcting its servicing errors. 

Please review this matter urgently and provide a written response and corrected escrow analysis as soon as possible.

I believe my servicer has mishandled my loss mitigation application, provided inconsistent and incorrect information, and caused unnecessary delays that have placed me at risk of further delinquency. 

I lost my job on XX/XX/year>. I immediately notified my mortgage company and applied for mortgage assistance. At that time, I was receiving severance pay and later unemployment benefits. I was instructed to complete certain loss mitigation paperwork, which I did promptly. 

Initially, I was told that because I was unemployed, I would not need to submit additional documentation. This later turned out to be incorrect. I was subsequently advised that I needed to submit my unemployment award letter and bank statements, which I provided as requested. 

I spoke with a representative named XXXX, who told me that my application was going to be approved. That statement was not accurate. Approximately XXXX week later, I received an email stating that my application was denied. When I contacted the mortgage company for clarification, I was told that I was denied because I did not have a job and that my hardship would need to be over before assistance could be approved. I was never informed of this requirement during the application process. 

I then informed the servicer that my husband is employed and able to take over the mortgage payments. I was instructed to submit additional documentation, including : My husbands bank statements A non-contributor form My unemployment award letter The loss mitigation award letter I submitted all of the requested documents via email to XXXX, and I also mailed the complete application and bank statements to Shellpoint. 

When I followed up again with XXXX, I was told that the documents could not be accepted because XXXX was not written on the paperwork. I was also told that the documents were never received, despite submitting them multiple times via email and mail. 

As a result of these repeated issues, delays, and contradictory information, my mortgage is now XXXX months past due. I made a payment of {$2200.00} in XXXX in an effort to catch up, but I continue to struggle because : Documents are repeatedly claimed to be missing New errors are identified after submission I am told approvals are forthcoming and then later denied Denials are issued based on hardship criteria that were never previously disclosed I believe my servicer has failed to properly process my loss mitigation application, failed to provide clear and consistent guidance, and failed to act in good faith.

I was preparing for retirement and the goal is for Mortgage payment to remain affordable. This year I called again and worked with XXXX supervisors to resolve the concern. The XXXX supervisors ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) were knowledgeable, we identified the problem and I devised a plan to stop reoocurrences. I paid an escrow shortage of {$2700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, in hopes to manage mortgage payments for fututre retirement. 
I also learned that shortages are placed in a Shortage Installment bucket ( I have been calling for 4 years and this was never mentioned ). My plan was : XXXX. Pay Shortage {$2700.00} 2. Monitor - XXXX, XXXX XXXX and Taxes to ensure no changes allowing me to maintain my mortgage payments at an affordable level. 
XXXX. Request escrow analysis after shortage payment. 
XXXX. XXXX Escrow Analysis was incorrect, Homeowners Ins $ was not included in the analysis XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was incorrect, again Homeowners Ins $ were not included. Refund check was sent for {$2200.00} XXXX. Called New Rez again yesterday XX/XX/XXXX only to find that checking acct auto deduction was for {$730.00} ( which is short ). This will end up to be {$500.00} a month shortage, come XX/XX/XXXX I would be short approx {$6000.00}. 
XXXX. Was advised by XXXX that another escrow was requested and would take another 7 days. Previously I spoke to XXXX XXXX, both young ladies were cordial and willing to help, totally understood my concern. 

However, I just paid an {$2700.00} Escrow shortage only to end of short again. I am a XXXX XXXX monitoring expenses to avoid surprises that I can not financially afford. 

My name is XXXX XXXX, my mortgage with New Rez is XXXX. My bigger concern is that the incorrect deductions are happening and once resolved I will have to pay more to resolve the shortage amount. My plan was to start paying even more towards principle so I can lower my mortgage amount in prep for retirement. I would appreciate assistance in expediting the resolution of this matter. The XXXX supervisors advised that their only means to communicate with the XXXX XXXX was via email, which would further delay resolution.

I tried to rectify the issue via a chat online with them but all I could get is that I DID have an escrow account ( even though they acknowledged that they had not billed me for any escrow since last spring ). I do have a letter from them stating that my escrow accounts we cancelled and I could not reinstate them. I get a new bill from them with escrow charges added on for my taxes. I tried to call today, XXXX, but could not speak with anyone because they told me my mailing address I was providing was not the address on the bill. I am not sure how that can be when I have the bill I just received in my hand with that very address. 

So they incorrectly paid the first installment of my property taxes, which I already paid, even though I don't have an escrow account with them AND I can't talk to them about it because they claim that the mailing address in their records is not the one they just mailed me my bill to.

10/28/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"In XX/XX/XXXX, our area ( XXXX, XXXX, and the surrounding communities ) was struck by a tornado and declared a federal disaster area. As a result, we qualified for creditor relief. We contacted Shellpoint and were granted a six-month forbearance. The terms were explained to us, and we complied fully.

Per instructions from your staff, we called several weeks before the forbearance ended to confirm the process of moving the six months of payments to the end of the loan. We were told to resume payments in XXXX. When we attempted to make that payment both online and by phone, on multiple occasions we were informed by your representatives that no payment was due. We repeated this process in XXXX and XXXX, receiving the same response each time. Your staff consistently reassured us that no payment was due until XXXX. 

In XXXX, we made our regular payment on time, as we always have. For context, we have only used forbearance twice : once during XXXX and once after this tornado disaster. In both cases, we carefully followed the rules provided to us. 

Despite this, Shellpoint has reported us as delinquent for three months, causing our credit scores ( previously above XXXX ) to drop by more than XXXX points. After speaking with several representatives, I finally learned that Shellpoints system would not allow payment acceptance while the request to move payments to the end of the loan was still processing. However, this was never communicated to us at the time, and we were repeatedly assured no payments were due. 

This error is entirely the result of Shellpoints handling of the forbearance process, not our actions. My wife XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have contacted Shellpoint for over XXXX months now, attempting to resolve this matter, yet the false reporting remains and continues. In XX/XX/XXXX, after calling, we were trasnfered to XXXX XXXX ( Loss Mitigation Supervisor NMLS ID # XXXX ). She assurred us of her assistnace. Our last communicton with her was XX/XX/XXXX, via email. There has been no follow up communication since. 

We are outraged and deeply frustrated. We have an impeccable payment history outside of the approved forbearances, and this negative reporting is unjust, damaging, and should be corrected immediately if nothing else, in good faith. 

I respectfully demand that Shellpoint urgently review this matter and correct the inaccurate reporting to the credit bureaus. This situation is unfair, not of our making, and can not be allowed to continue. As of XX/XX/XXXX, this information has been reviesed and reported multiple times, dropping my XXXX score XXXX points on multiple occasions. 

I fully complied with all terms of that forbearance. When the forbearance ended in XXXX, I attempted to resume payments, but Shellpoint representatives informed me that payments could not yet be accepted until the forbearance was fully processed and applied to the back of the loan. My payments were ultimately received and accepted in XX/XX/XXXX.

My original HELOC was transferred to Shellpoint Mortgage for servicing shortly after the loan was processed. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a phone call ( I have 8-10 recorded phone calls saved since the XX/XX/XXXX call which I didn't expect to have to record, wish I had ) The very nice representative informed me that I had {$670.00} to use with "" checks '' they sent me.

01/01/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Newrez, LLC, d.b.a Shellpoint wrongfully purchased two separate flood insurance policies on my behalf, falsely reported missed mortgage payments to credit bureaus, assessed late fees and caused other financial losses ; additionally, caused me emotional distress, anxiety and humiliation.

As a result of Newrez/Shellpoint 's purchase of two flood insurance policies my escrow account lacked sufficient funds, so Newrez/Shellpoint increased my monthly mortgage payment. Newrez/Shellpoint increased my monthly mortgage payment by {$140.00}, from {$990.00} to {$1100.00}, to compensate for the escrow impound account shortfall.

I have maintained the same valid flood insurance policy on a continuous and uninterrupted basis from the date I purchased my home until the present. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX, Newrez/Shellpoint purchased separate flood insurance policies on my behalf. Defendant mistakenly believed that hazard insurance and flood insurance must be in separate policies, however, my hazard and flood coverage are set forth in a single policy with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). 

I have filed complaints with two government agencies because of Newrez/Shellpoint 's , and a prior mortgage service providers, attempts to wrongfully purchase lender placed flood insurance.

MY first complaint was lodged with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ( CDFI ) against my former mortgage service provider, Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ). As a result of SLSs self-investigation, the company responded as follows : -Our records showed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  as your homeowners insurance carrier with flood insurance included -Our record inadvertently showed that flood insurance was not included in homeowners policy. 
-We updated our records to show flood insurance is included in your homeowners insurance policy -a Lender Placed Insurance was not purchased -We Apologize for any inconvenience My second complaint was lodged with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against Newrez/Shellpoint. Newrez/Shellpoint responded to the CFPB with false statements including : Upon researching the issue, we determined that at the time your loan was acquired by Newrez your loan boarded with an expired flood insurance policy on file with an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. Newrez/Shellpoint 's statements to the CFPB were know by Newrez/Shellpoint to be false and were intended to fraudulently deceive, distract, and misdirect the CFPB in their investigation of Plaintiff 's complaint, and to defuse any accusations of fault attributed to Newrez/Shellpoint. 

In conjunction to my complaint to the CFPB, on XX/XX/XXXX I filed in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX an Amended Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court ( XXXX ) and Motion for Exemplary Damages. Myself and Newrez/Shellpoint later resolved that case, prior to trial, by executing a Confidential Settlement Agreement.

Newrez/Shellpoint has since breached the agreement by falsely asserting I have failed to make mortgage payments. Additionally, Defendant has assessed late fees, and reported false information to credit reporting companies. Newrez/Shellpoint 's actions have caused Plaintiff substantial financial losses directly resulting from the false reports. Furthermore, and because of Newrez/Shellpoint 's conduct, Plaintiff has experienced emotional distress, including hospitalization for : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX ; and XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ) I have subsequently filed a second Amended Claim and Order to Go to Small Claims Court in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX against Newrez/Shellpoint and won by default judgement, however, Newrez/Shellpoint will not stop their wrongfull collection activities or false credit reporting.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,95242,Older American,Consent provided,Web,01/01/26,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18406194
10/20/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( NewRez LLC ) regarding my mortgage on the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX ( Loan XXXX XXXXXXXX ). I believe Shellpoint lacks legal authority to service my loan or initiate foreclosure, and they have violated federal and state laws including RESPA, FDCPA, and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR ). I request an immediate investigation into their standing, proof of chain of title, and a halt to all foreclosure activities pending resolution.

Key Issues : Lack of Legal Authority to Foreclose : Shellpoint claims to service the loan on behalf of XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) as trustee for XXXX, XXXX, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series XXXX ( per their XX/XX/XXXX, letter ). However, the XXXX assignment to this XXXX trust is XXXX XXXX XXXX because it occurred years after the trust 's closing date ( typically 90 days post-issuance per the Pooling and Servicing Agreement ). Under California law ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), void assignments mean no standing to foreclose. The original Deed of Trust also failed to name a trustee as required by XXXX. Code XXXX, rendering subsequent actions ( Substitution of Trustee, Notice of Default, Notices of Trustee 's Sale by Peak Foreclosure ) invalid. Shellpoint has refused to provide proof of valid ownership despite multiple requests.

Dual Tracking Violations : Shellpoint advanced foreclosure while my complete loan modification application was under review, violating HBOR ( Civ. Code 2923.6 ) and RESPA ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ). I submitted QWRs and mod packages on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ( among others ), with acknowledgments of review. Yet, they denied the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, citing exhaustion of options, while scheduling sales ( originally XX/XX/XXXX, with short postponements ). Emails from attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX confirm denials amid active appeals, and they provided only XXXX delays instead of the required XXXX days. 
Failure to Respond to QWRs and Validate Debt : Over XXXX certified QWRs sent since XXXX requesting debt validation, ownership proof, and accounting went unanswered or inadequately addressed, violating RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692g ). Shellpoint continues using outdated names ( XXXX instead of XXXX, legally changed XXXX years ago ) despite notifications, suggesting fraudulent practices. 
Misrepresentations and Harm : Shellpoint falsely claimed my conventional loan has mod limits like FHA loans ( per emails ). This has caused severe emotional distress, financial strain ( property valued at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), and risk of wrongful eviction. Both my husband and I have bankruptcy discharges ( XXXX ) eliminating personal liability, yet they pursue foreclosure without valid standing. 

I have filed a lawsuit in XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Case # XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) for declaratory relief, cancellation of instruments, slander of title, HBOR violations, UCL ( 17200 ), intentional infliction of emotional distress, and accounting.

Shellpoints responses, taken together, demonstrate a pattern of contradictory factual assertions, selective disclosures, and evasive disclaimers, all issued by the same compliance agent despite repeated notice of document defects and inconsistencies. These defects were never cured prior to foreclosure and sheriffs sale. 


I. Same Compliance Agent, Repeated After Notice All XXXX responses ( XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) were authored or affirmed by XXXX XXXX on behalf of Shellpoints XXXX Department. As a result : Shellpoint can not claim lack of knowledge, clerical error, or misunderstanding. 
Repetition of disputed statements after notice constitutes knowing adoption of those statements. 
This establishes a pattern, not an isolated mistake. 

XXXX. Contradictory and Misleading Origination Assertions In the XX/XX/XXXX, response, Shellpoint states : This loan originated with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
However, Shellpoint has been repeatedly notified that : There are multiple mortgage versions associated with this loan ; XXXX version was reprinted and recorded after the Note ; The Note and Mortgage do not match ; The XX/XX/XXXX, mortgage is the disputed and altered instrument. 
Shellpoints continued assertion of a single undisputed origination datewithout addressing the existence of conflicting instrumentsmisrepresents the record and improperly adopts a contested document as controlling. 

XXXX. Admission of a Fatal NoteMortgage Discrepancy Shellpoint again admits in its XX/XX/XXXX response : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and you signed the Mortgage However, XXXX XXXX name does not appear on the Note. 
This is not explanatory ; it is an admission that : The Mortgage encumbers the property using a party not obligated on the debt ; The Note and Mortgage are nonconforming ; Foreclosure proceeded on mismatched collateral documents. 
None of Shellpoints responses reconcile this defect, despite acknowledging it across multiple submissions. 

XXXX. Improper Reliance on QWR Scope to Avoid Substantive Answers Across its responses, Shellpoint repeatedly claims that inquiries regarding origination, document integrity, or chain of title fall outside the scope of a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ). 
This position is misapplied where : The servicer is actively enforcing the loan ; The servicer is relying on specific documents to collect payments and foreclose ; The borrower disputes the accuracy of servicing records and instruments used to service the loan. 
Shellpoint can not simultaneously enforce disputed documents and disclaim responsibility for their accuracy. 
Since XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint has failed to produce the servicing records expressly requested in my Qualified Written Requests under 12 C.F.R. 1024.351024.36, including but not limited to the full life-of-loan payment and escrow ledgers ; master servicing and sub-servicer transaction logs ; investor, trust, and remittance ledgers identifying all entities receiving or crediting payments ; the complete collateral file and identification of the current document custodian ; all servicing transfer and boarding records ; proof of ownership and authority to enforce the note and mortgage as of the date the foreclosure complaint was filed ; written explanations for each loan number associated with the account ; and a complete accounting and justification for all post-filing fees and charges assessed. This failure also includes Shellpoints refusal to reconcile or substantiate its admitted discrepancy that XXXX XXXX appears as a signatory on the recorded Mortgage but not on the Note, including the absence of any signed debt instrument evidencing his liability, authentic signature affidavits, notary journals or certifications for XX/XX/XXXX, or identification of any party who added or authorized his name post-closing. Instead, Shellpoint has issued only generic validation-of-debt correspondence, mischaracterized the scope of my requests, and deferred its statutory obligations. 

XXXX. Inconsistent Disclaimers of Knowledge While Enforcing the Loan In the XX/XX/XXXX response, Shellpoint states it does not have knowledge of the loan closing or other aspects of the loan unrelated to servicing, while also asserting detailed factual narratives regarding origination, borrower identity, payment history, and foreclosure authority. 
This is internally inconsistent. Once Shellpoint : Collected payments ; Evaluated loss mitigation; Referred the loan to foreclosure counsel ; Scheduled and completed a foreclosure sale ; it assumed responsibility for verifying the validity of the instruments it relied upon. 

XXXX. Improper Identity Theft Burden-Shifting Shellpoint now demands photo identification, a Social Security card , notarized affidavits, and a police report as a precondition to investigating fraud. 
My dispute does not allege random identity theft. It alleges : Document fabrication and alteration ; Non-matching loan instruments ; Fraudulent adoption of defective documents in servicing and foreclosure. 
Requiring law-enforcement reports under these circumstances is coercive, improper, and inconsistent with consumer protection standards. 

XXXX. Foreclosure Proceeded Despite Active, Unresolved Disputes Shellpoint acknowledges that : CFPB and IDFPR complaints were active ; Multiple written disputes were pending ; Document inconsistencies were never resolved ; Yet it proceeded with foreclosure and sheriffs sale while recycling the same disputed factual assertions. This reflects willful noncompliance and bad-faith servicing. 

XXXX. Requested CFPB Action I respectfully request that the CFPB : Reject Shellpoints XX/XX/XXXX, response as non-responsive and misleading ; Require Shellpoint to reconcile its contradictory statements across XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ; Compel Shellpoint to identify which mortgage and note it relied upon to foreclose, and why ; Escalate this matter for supervisory review, given the repeated misrepresentations by the same compliance agent ; Preserve this rebuttal as part of the official CFPB record. 
Shellpoints responses demonstrate a clear pattern of contradiction, evasion, and reliance on disputed instruments. The XX/XX/XXXX submission does not cure these defectsit compounds them.

09/28/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint/NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) for repeated violations of federal and state consumer protection laws in handling my first-lien residential mortgage ( Loan # XXXX, secured by my primary residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX ) . These violations include improper and rushed denials of loan modification applications, dual tracking ( advancing foreclosure proceedings while reviewing complete applications ), failure to validate a disputed debt, false or misleading representations about application status, inconsistent assignment of a Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ), and harassing collection tactics that have caused severe emotional distress. Shellpoint 's conduct has forced me to file a lawsuit in XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX, filed XX/XX/year> ) seeking declaratory relief, cancellation of instruments, slander of title, HBOR violations, UCL violations ( Bus. & Prof. Code 17200 ), intentional infliction of emotional distress, and accounting. I am also considering XXXX XXXX bankruptcy to address this and other debts. Below is a detailed chronological account, with references to attached evidence. 
XX/XX/year> Loan Modification Application : In XX/XX/year>, I submitted a complete application for loan modification due to financial hardship making payments difficult. Shellpoint acknowledged the application as complete in writing via email from my assigned SPOC, XXXX XXXX ( Loss Mitigation Specialist ). However, shortly thereafter, Shellpoint issued a Notice of Default ( NOD ) and continued foreclosure proceedings. My SPOC advised me in writing to "" ignore '' the NOD, implying the modification review would halt the foreclosure. This was misleading, as the foreclosure advanced anyway. This constitutes dual tracking, prohibited under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA, 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( c ) ), which bars servicers from advancing foreclosure ( e.g., recording notices or scheduling sales ) while evaluating a complete loss mitigation application submitted at least 37 days before a scheduled sale. It also violates the California Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR, Cal. Civ. Code 2923.6 ), which prohibits dual tracking for complete first-lien modification applications. Shellpoint did not provide a 5-business-day acknowledgment specifying any missing information or give me 30 days to supplement if incomplete ( RESPA 1024.41 ( b ) ( 2 ) ). No appeal opportunity was offered before denial. 
XX/XX/year> : Inconsistent SPOC Assignment : On XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX emailed me stating, "" I am no longer your single point of contact. Please call XXXX. Any representative here may assist you '' ( see attached "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ). This violated RESPA 1024.40, which requires servicers to assign and maintain a consistent SPOC to handle borrower inquiries and loss mitigation options without confusion. Despite this, when I called Shellpoint on XX/XX/year>, representatives informed me that XXXX XXXX was still my SPOC, leading to further inconsistency and frustration ( see attached "" XXXX XXXX '' ). 
XX/XX/year> : Debt Dispute and Cease and Desist : On XX/XX/year>, I sent Shellpoint a cease and desist letter disputing the alleged debt amount ( {$160000.00} in arrears ) and demanding full validation ( e.g., original promissory note, complete payment history, chain of assignments ) under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ). Shellpoint identifies itself as a "" debt collector '' in all communications, including email disclaimers ( e.g., "" This communication is from a debt collector '' in attached emails from XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite my timely dispute, Shellpoint has failed to provide validation and continued collection activities, including foreclosure advancement. This violates FDCPA 1692g ( a ) ( requiring validation notice ) and 1692g ( b ) ( requiring cessation of collection until debt is verified ). 
XXXX XXXX XXXX : Second Loan Modification Application and Improper Denial : On XX/XX/year>, I emailed XXXX XXXX seeking assistance due to ongoing hardship : "" Good morning I called and they told me you are my spoc '' ( attached "" XXXX XXXX '' ). On XX/XX/year> ( XXXX XXXX  ), she responded, "" Thank you for reaching out. Im sorry to hear about your situation. Please advise what type of assistance you are looking for. '' Later that day ( around XXXX XXXX  ), I submitted a full loan modification application. Shellpoint acknowledged it as complete in writing : "" We have received your complete application for loss mitigation assistance. No additional documents are needed at this time '' ( attached "" XXXX '' ). 
Despite this acknowledgment, XXXX XXXX verbally denied the application on the same day ( XX/XX/year> ), and Shellpoint issued a formal written denial letter on XX/XX/year> ( attached "" Denial letter.pdf '' ). Denial reasons included "" insufficient hardship info, '' loan exceeding delinquency limits, failed Net Present Value ( NPV ) test, and reaching the maximum number of modifications allowed. This denial occurred just 2 days after acknowledgment, without a 5-business-day acknowledgment notice specifying issues ( RESPA 1024.41 ( b ) ( 2 ) ), without identifying any missing documents, and without giving me 30 days to supplement if deemed incomplete. Shellpoint treated the application as complete enough for review but denied it without proper process, violating RESPA 1024.41 ( c ) - ( d ) ( requiring full evaluation of complete applications and 30-day appeal rights ) and HBOR 2923.6 ( prohibiting denial without appeal opportunity and dual tracking during review/appeal ) .

The denial also contained false or misleading representations : If hardship information was "" insufficient, '' Shellpoint should have notified me as incomplete and allowed correction, not proceeded to a merits denial. This violates FDCPA 1692e, which prohibits false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with debt collection.

Ongoing Foreclosure Advancement and Harassment ( XXXX XXXX ) : Despite the complete XX/XX/XXXX application and my 30-day appeal window ( ending approximately XX/XX/year> ), Shellpoint advanced foreclosure through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX , with a trustee sale originally scheduled for XX/XX/year>. This is a clear dual tracking violation under RESPA 1024.41 and HBOR 2923.6 ( c ), as no notice of sale or trustee 's sale can proceed while a complete application is pending review or appeal. On XX/XX/year>, I called XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX, who verbally postponed the sale to XX/XX/year>, but I have not yet received written confirmation, creating ongoing uncertainty.

Shellpoint 's overall patternrushed denials without process, ignored debt disputes, inconsistent SPOC, misleading statements, and persistent foreclosure pressure despite violationsconstitutes harassing or abusive collection practices under FDCPA 1692d. This has caused me severe emotional distress ( e.g., XXXX, sleep disturbances, as detailed in my state court complaint ),
unnecessary legal expenses, and forced consideration of XXXX XXXX  bankruptcy when proper handling could have resolved this. 
Shellpoint 's actions appear willful and reckless, especially after my cease and desist letter. I have attached all supporting evidence, including emails from XXXX XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ), the denial letter ( XX/XX/XXXX ), cease and desist ( XX/XX/XXXX ), acknowledgment of complete application ( "" XXXX '' ), email from XXXX ( if applicable, attached "" email from XXXX '' ), and my verified state court complaint ( 139-page XXXX  filed XX/XX/year> ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,09/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16225741

On XX/XX/year>, I requested a payoff statement so I could sell my home. Shellpoint claims they sent the payoff to the wrong email address, which caused delays and prevented my pending sale from closing. I also requested that they open up a short sale just in case the offer did not cover the arrears and penalties. I repeatedly asked Shellpoint and their foreclosure law firm ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for a corrected payoff and for the identity of the investor who owns my loan. Despite my requests, they refused to provide this information. 

On XX/XX/year>, I spoke with Shellpoint by phone and was told the foreclosure sale was postponed. Relying on that assurance, I continued working to resolve the payoff issue. However, on XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint went ahead and foreclosed on my home anyway, despite their prior representation that the sale had been delayed. 

I later learned that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Owner Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  may actually be the investor, but Shellpoint never disclosed this to me until weeks after the foreclosure.

Description of Problem : I am writing to file an urgent complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( "" Shellpoint '' ) to stop an illegal foreclosure sale. Shellpoint is guilty of : Illegal Dual-Tracking : Foreclosing while a complete loan modification application was under active review. 

Negligent Misrepresentation : Providing written, false assurance that caused me to detrimentally rely on it, leading to the loss of my home-saving modification option. 

Gross Incompetence : Initiating foreclosure proceedings against me under a name I legally changed over a decade ago, proving they lack even the basic competency to manage this process.

2. What happened? 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was actively engaged in the loan modification process with Shellpoint 's Loss Mitigation Department. My Single Point of Contact ( SPOC ), XXXX XXXX, was requesting and receiving documents from me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Notice of Default from XXXX XXXX, a company hired by Shellpoint. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX. That same day, she sent me a written email stating : "" You can disregard that for right now since we are working on a loan modification option. '' ( See attached email from XXXX XXXX ). 

Relying on this written instruction from their authorized employee, I believed the foreclosure was halted as required by California law ( Civil Code 2923.6 ( c ) ). This false assurance destroyed my faith in the process. I became despondent and, believing the foreclosure was stopped, I unfortunately did not continue submitting the endless stream of requested documents. My modification application was eventually denied due to incompletenessa direct result of my reliance on Shellpoint 's false guidance. 

I have since discovered that Shellpoint never stopped the foreclosure. It has advanced, and I am now in imminent danger of losing my home. 

Furthermore, I have discovered that Shellpoint and their attorneys, XXXX XXXX have filed this foreclosure action against "" XXXX and XXXX XXXX. '' Our legal names were changed to XXXX and XXXX XXXX over XXXX years ago, as proven by the attached court decree. They are foreclosing on people who do not legally exist, demonstrating a shocking level of negligence. 

XXXX. How has this affected you? 

Shellpoint 's actions have been catastrophic. 

Financial Harm : Their false assurance directly led to the denial of my loan modification, which was my only path to saving my home. 

Detrimental Reliance : I specifically relied on their written instruction to "" disregard '' the Notice of Default. Had they told me the truththat the foreclosure was continuingI would have done everything possible to complete the modification application. 

Emotional Distress : This has caused immense stress and despair. Since starting this process, both my wife and I have lost our jobs. I now depend on a Social Security check of {$1300.00} per month to survive. The loss of the modification option has placed my family on the brink of homelessness. 

Illegal Action : The foreclosure is procedurally invalid as it is filed against the wrong parties ( our former names ).

4. What would you like the company to do? 

I demand that the CFPB immediately direct Shellpoint to : IMMEDIATELY HALT ALL FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS. The foreclosure is illegal due to dual-tracking and is invalid due to being filed under an incorrect name. 

REOPEN AND REVIEW MY LOAN MODIFICATION APPLICATION based on my current, severe financial hardship ( unemployment, reliance on Social Security ). 

REMOVE ALL FORECLOSURE-RELATED FEES AND COSTS incurred after XX/XX/XXXX, as they are the result of their own illegal and negligent actions. 

PROVIDE WRITTEN CONFIRMATION that the foreclosure is stopped and that they have updated their records to reflect our legal names, XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

Shellpoint has already admitted their error in writing to the CFPB. They can not be allowed to continue with a foreclosure that is built upon their own misconduct and incompetence. I need the CFPB 's urgent intervention to save my home.

09/21/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","XX/XX/XXXX I don't know where to turn for help with our current mortgage company, NewRez LLC. I have written to NewRez, through their website "" Contact Us '' function and nothing has been resolved since May with regards to our XXXX XXXX. The original lender for my mortgage was XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  but it changed to NewRez in XX/XX/XXXX. It was not a smooth transition and then we received notice from XXXX about the huge increase for XXXX XXXX- over {$8000.00}, up from around {$2000.00}. Due to medical issues and other things, looking into new insurance took a back seat. In XXXX, XXXX, we worked with XXXX XXXX at XXXX to get new hazard insurance because we had to dip into savings to cover our increased mortgage payment. The increase was due to Oregon government officials releasing a fire hazard map showing us in a high risk area. We had already had a forest fire on our property in XXXX so this seemed unjust but they were basing the increase on that map. XXXX was almost half that. We could not get anything less. We asked to have the new insurance policy start on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After we switched hazard insurance from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, neither us, nor our agent, XXXX XXXX noticed a typo in our address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This led to us being double-billed for Hazard insurance. And, unrelated to insurance debacle, but equally frustating, our XXXX payment wasn't made automatically as it had been set up to do so we made a payment XX/XX/XXXX through the website. 

Here is what has happened since changing insurance : XX/XX/XXXX - paid the Escrow account {$2500.00} using refunded, pro-rated funds from XXXX. I also paid, in full, the new homeowner 's insurance policy which is in effect XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX mortgage statement shows escrow balance at {$1100.00} after being overdrawn over {$3700.00} on XXXX statement. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX by NewRez they would charge us for their hazard insurance placement because address incorrect ( note, no other property on XXXX XXXX with that address ) .This letter came because we had received letters telling us to get insurance or they would place insurance on us. We were confused by those letters and never thought to look at the address. We just asked XXXX to resend documents a couple of times. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX made address correction to hazard insurance policy and sent corrected policy info to NewRez. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX account charged {$1000.00} for Lender Placed Hazard Disbursement. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Escrow account charged {$360.00} for Lender Placed Hazard Disbursement XX/XX/XXXX - Escrow account charged {$350.00} for Lender Placed Hazard Disbursement. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Escrow account charged {$360.00} for Lender Placed Hazard Disbursement. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Received letter from NewRez Customer Care Team acknowledging recent inquiry but "" due to the complex nature of the matter, we kindly request additional time to provide a thorough and accurate response ''. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Contacted original mortgage officer who is now employed by NewRez but received no answer. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Escrow account charged {$360.00} for Lender Placed Hazard Disbursement. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Received letter from NewRez Customer Care Team indicating they are still working on our inquiry. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Escrow account charged {$350.00} for Lender Placed Hazard Disbursement. 


We took a big budget hit with these new insurance rates/increased mortgage payment. We are depleting our savings trying to keep up because we also have rising health costs.

11/13/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Regarding : XXXX XXXX XXXX, NewRez LLC, and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Subject : Ownership Misrepresentation, Governance Collapse, Servicing Violations, and Operation of an Orphaned Servicer Entity 1. Ownership Contradiction : Parent Disclaims Subsidiary While SEC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has submitted contradictory statements to federal and state regulators : To XXXX : XXXX stated it is not associated with NewRez/Shellpoint. 
To the XXXX : XXXX certifies, under penalty of securities law, that it owns, controls, and consolidates NewRez/Shellpoint as core subsidiaries and primary income sources. 

Both statements can not be true. 

This contradiction renders : proxy materials, XXXX  certifications, consolidated financials, XXXX  qualification filings, XXXX beneficial ownership, the Form XXXX shelf, the Series E preferred offering, and risk disclosures materially unreliable under federal law. 



2. Legal Consequence : NewRez Becomes an Orphan Entity Under Regulatory Standards If the parent disclaims ownership of the subsidiary, the subsidiary becomes an orphan entity in the eyes of regulators. 

This is the accurate legal concept used in federal oversight. 
Such an entity is not fake, collapsed, or destroyedit is orphaned, meaning : no lawful parent, no lawful governance chain, no validated reporting structure, no clear consolidating entity, no legitimate controller, no validated board oversight, no lawful XXXX  certification pathway, no validated income consolidation. 

This is not theoretical. 
This is the classification used when a parent companys regulatory statements contradict its SEC identity. 



3. NewRez as a Disassociated Subsidiary ( Loss of Controller ) A company must have : a parent, a controller, a governing board, and a financial consolidator. 

If XXXX states we do not own NewRez, then the controller ceases to exist under federal definitions. 

Legally, NewRez becomes : A standalone, unparented servicer operating without a valid controller also known as a disassociated subsidiary. 

Regulators classify these as : high-risk, misreported, potentially non-compliant, and subject to direct supervisory intervention. 



4. Toxic SEC Filings Render NewRezs Financials Unreliable NewRez does not file standalone SEC reports. 
XXXX consolidates : revenue, expenses, servicing income, MSRs, goodwill, liabilities, risk disclosures. 

If the parent filings collapse, then : all of NewRezs financial data becomes unreliable inputs under XXXX XXXX and SEC Rule 12b-20. 

NewRez becomes, in regulatory language : a XXXX box servicer lacking validated controls. 



XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX = No Lawful Oversight of NewRez XXXX XXXX : appoints NewRez leadership, authorizes oversight committees, establishes risk policies, ensures XXXX compliance, certifies consolidated reporting. 

If the parents board is void ab initio due to a defective proxy built on false ownership assertions : NewRez has no lawful governing authority above it. 

This creates an entity operating on paper, but with no legitimate supervisory lineage. 

Regulators classify this as : Ungoverned but operating the highest-risk category for a mortgage servicer. 



6. What NewRez Becomes Under This Scenario A servicer operating without : a valid corporate parent, validated financial oversight, lawful XXXX XXXX XXXX, legitimate governance lineage, a functional controller, or validated consolidation. 

In regulatory terms : NewRez becomes an orphaned, unanchored, high-risk servicer with no lawful parent signature authority. 

Not criminal per se but structurally illegitimate, and therefore subject to escalated scrutiny.

7. Enforcement Classification : Free-Floating Regulated Entity In enforcement language, NewRez becomes : a free-floating regulated entity, or a disavowed subsidiary, because : it claims a parent, the parent disclaims it, SEC filings contradict the disclaimer, the parents board is invalid, therefore the controller ceases to exist in law. 

Meaning NewRez now operates with : no validated authority chain, no validated XXXX certifications, no validated reporting, no validated governance, no validated oversight.

8. Strategic Enforcement Consequence Regulators must treat NewRez as : unstable, unanchored, oversight-deficient, structurally compromised, unable to rely on parent filings, and subject to heightened enforcement. 

This strengthens my : RESPA claims, servicing misconduct claims, CFPB filings, XXXX filings, governance-failure arguments, pattern-and-practice evidence, and board-legitimacy challenge.

9. Servicing Misconduct and Ledger Manipulation NewRez has repeatedly issued : contradictory payment histories, disappearing payments, unapplied funds, retroactive adjustments, false escrow numbers, threats based on incorrect data, and recorded admissions that the system is wrong. 

This violates : RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) Reg X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024 ) FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) state consumer protection laws These failures are not isolated errors they reflect systemic instability.

10. Damages Due to : unlawful accounting, system-wide misrepresentation, emotional and financial harm, reputational injury, and wrongful foreclosure exposure, I seek {>= $1,000,000} in total damages. 



11. Request for Regulatory Action I request a full investigation of : 1. Rithms conflicting ownership claims 2. Validity of XXXX proxy ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX. Validity of XXXX certifications 4. Structural status of NewRez as a disavowed subsidiary 5. NewRezs servicing misconduct 6. Systemic ledger inaccuracies 7. Governance collapse affecting all consumer accounts 12. Closing Statement I am a former federal regulator. 
I recognize what these contradictions represent. 
No mortgage servicer or public parent company can survive structural falsehoods of this magnitude. 

I request immediate regulatory review.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17230853
10/19/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint ) for repeatedly stonewalling my requests for information and assistance, violating RESPA requirements for timely responses to Qualified Written Requests ( QWRs ) and proper handling of loss mitigation applications. Despite ongoing evaluations and legal protections against foreclosure during review, my foreclosure sale remains scheduled for XX/XX/year>, causing me severe stress and financial hardship. Shellpoint has sent me at least six identical acknowledgment letters without providing any substantive information or resolution, suggesting intentional delays to push through the foreclosure. 
Timeline of Events and Violations : XXXX Submitted and Ignored ( RESPA Violation ) : On XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint acknowledged receipt of my QWR requesting creditor information, including ownership certification for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXk XXXX as Trustee for XXXX XXXX. Under RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) and Regulation X, they must provide a substantive response within XXXX business days ( extendable to XXXX with notice ). As of XX/XX/year> ( nearly 90 days later ), I have received no responseonly repetitive acknowledgment letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and another around XX/XX/year>. Each letter states, "" We are working to gather the requested information and will forward it to you as soon as possible, '' with no updates, timelines, or details. This pattern indicates stalling and non-compliance with RESPA timelines. 
Loss Mitigation Application and Denial Issues : On XX/XX/year>, Shellpoint deemed my loss mitigation application complete ( acknowledgment letter dated XX/XX/year>, in "" XXXX Complete Acknowledgment ( XXXX ) XXXX '' ). This granted me foreclosure protection during evaluation : no sale can proceed while the application is under review. They must evaluate and respond within 30 days ( by XX/XX/year> ). However, on XX/XX/year>, they issued a denial notice ( "" XXXX Non-GSE Non-Approval Notice.pdf '' ) for various programs ( e.g., XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. ), citing reasons like "" maximum number of modifications reached, '' "" insufficient hardship verification, '' and "" exceeds allowable delinquency. '' This denial came just 6 days after completion, raising concerns about whether a proper evaluation occurred. Another denial letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, 2025, in "" Denial letter.pdf '' and images ) repeats similar reasons without addressing my specific financial circumstances or providing appeal details adequately. 
Foreclosure Proceeding Despite Protections : Despite the active loss mitigation evaluation and RESPA protections, the foreclosure sale for my property remains scheduled for XX/XX/year>. The acknowledgment letter explicitly states that no foreclosure sale will commence during evaluation, yet Shellpoint has not confirmed in writing any postponement or cancellation. I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( e.g., XXXX on XX/XX/year> ) and received verbal assurances, but no formal documentation. This violates 12 CFR 1024.41 ( g ), which prohibits advancing foreclosure during a timely loss mitigation review. 
Additional Stonewalling : I have emailed Shellpoint and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( e.g., XXXX XXXX ) multiple times, expressing frustration and requesting intervention, but received no resolution. The attached compilation ( XXXX ) shows the pattern of identical, non-responsive letters. A proposed modification document ( "" mod dated XXXX '' ) appears to be more acknowledgments rather than an actual offer, further evidencing delays. 

Shellpoint 's actions seem designed to run out the clock until the foreclosure date, ignoring my rights under RESPA and Regulation X. This has prevented me from verifying loan ownership, exploring alternatives, or reinstating the loan properly. Similar complaints against Shellpoint on the CFPB database ( e.g., IDs XXXX, XXXX ) highlight patterns of RESPA non-compliance and pressuring borrowers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,10/19/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16679304

We closed on our home on XX/XX/XXXX. I am a closing attorney, and the closing was handled in my office. Prior to closing, the mortgage company was provided with several title documents, including a tax certification. The tax certification detailed, very specifically, what the property tax payment would be at the end of XXXX. It provided both a XXXX XXXX assessment ratio and a XXXX XXXX assessment ratio, the XXXX most common tax rates for the state of South Carolina. The XXXX XXXX rate applies to a homeowners primary residence, and the XXXX XXXX rate applies to investment properties, vacation homes, and any other real estate that is not a primary residence. This information is public record and was provided to the mortgage company before closing. My home is my primary residence, and I am assessed at the XXXX XXXX  tax rate. My mortgage company was aware of this and calculated my initial escrow payments accordingly. All this information was available to Shellpoint Mortgage Company when it purchased my mortgage in or about XXXX of XXXX, via the Authorization for Release of Information, which I signed at closing. All documents referenced in this paragraph are available for review upon request. 
On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I completed all necessary applications for the XXXX XXXX tax rate. Tax bills in my county are paid in arrears and due XX/XX/XXXX of each year. 
On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative of Shellpoint Mortgage to discuss ( XXXX ) why the taxes were not yet paid as we neared the due date, and ( XXXX ) the amount they intended to pay. We discussed the XXXX XXXX tax rate again at length. 
On or about XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint Mortgage submits a late payment to the county treasurers office on my behalf, in the erroneous amount of {$7900.00} ( the XXXX XXXX tax rate ). This payment brought my escrow account into the negative. Because the county accepted the payment, I had to seek reimbursement from them directly. 
It was not until XX/XX/XXXX, that I received the refund for the difference. Shellpoint Mortgage had paid {$7900.00}. The actual tax payment amount was {$2400.00}. I received a reimbursement check in the amount of {$5500.00} for the difference. 
The following day, I spoke with an agent of Shellpoint Mortgage to discuss how to deposit the {$5500.00} into my escrow account so that the balance would not be negative. This agent assured me it was a simple process and helped me make the payment by phone. On XX/XX/XXXX, the {$5500.00} payment was withdrawn from my account and reflected on my Loan History Statement, bringing my escrow account back to positive. I thought this was the end of the issue, but this is only where this began. 
I heard absolutely nothing further from Shellpoint Mortgage. To my surprise, on XX/XX/XXXX, my monthly payment was over {$500.00} more than it had been for the last year. I called Shellpoint Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX. The agent informed me that the increase was due to my tax bill going up. I explained in at least five different ways that my tax bill had not changed, I provided a tax statement from the county, and I reminded the agent of the reimbursement they had just received for the erroneous tax amount they sent. The agent told me they would have it solved by XXXX of XXXX. XXXX OF XXXX. In the meantime, I am expected to scrape together an extra {$500.00} per month, over {$6000.00} total, until they get around to fixing their mistake. In fact, the agent tried speaking down to me, explaining how this was just like waiting in line at the grocery store. When I asked how many times he had waited in line at a grocery store for XXXX XXXX, he digressed. I demanded that the issue be escalated, and the agent assured me it was. This was a blatant lie, as revealed by a later phone call. I recorded this call, and it is available upon request. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, after having heard nothing from Shellpoint Mortgage, I received my statement for XXXX. Again, it reflected the erroneous, increased amount due. I immediately called Shellpoint to inquire as to the status of my escalated issue. The agent I spoke with confirmed that since my call on XX/XX/XXXX, absolutely nothing had happened. There was no escalation, no resolution, not even a note in the file. I requested, again, that someone investigate the issue and escalate it. The agent assured me she would. I also recorded this call, and it is available upon request. 
I heard nothing further until XX/XX/XXXX, when I received a letter from Shellpoint Mortgage saying they needed additional time to investigate. This letter, dated 44 days after the XX/XX/XXXX call, did not state how much time they needed. The letter read as we-will-get-to-it-when-we-get-to-it. Further, this letter blatantly ignores the reimbursement they received, the calls made, and the documents provided. Instead, this letter was written as if this was the first Shellpoint had ever heard of it. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I replied to their letter as follows : Dear Sir or Madam, This letter is in response to your Escalation Response, dated XX/XX/XXXX, and attached herein. 
Notably omitted from your response was the acknowledgment of the escrow reimbursement in the amount {$5500.00} that you received on XX/XX/XXXX, for the prior erroneous tax payment. Also unmentioned are the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, calls in which the issue was discussed at length with Shellpoint representatives. To act as if any of this information is new is simply and unequivocally false.

An eight-month-long issue that remains unresolved is neither excellent nor efficient. Further, the timeliness of your response would not meet even the most liberal application of highly responsive. 
With receipt of this tax bill, Shellpoint must expeditiously correct the escrow discrepancy. My next mortgage payment is due XX/XX/XXXX. That is XXXX days from receipt of this letter, and sixty-two days from the time Shellpoint claims it received its first inquiry. In no event should an additional payment at the erroneous amount be required by a company that prides itself on being highly responsive, after having sixty-two days to resolve the issue. 
If possible, I seek to avoid filing formal complaints and pursuing legal options. However, if this issue remains unchanged as of XX/XX/XXXX, I am prepared to seek all recourse available. 
As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not heard back from Shellpoint, and the issue remains ongoing.

The original HELOC loan is with XXXX  XXXX XXXX, from around XXXX, which provided for specific clauses and agreements associated with the HELOC.

From the periods XXXX, shellpoint attempted to charge escrow fees of over {$300.00}, when the original agreement has none. shellpoint, after my repeated dispute of the charge, zeroed the escrow charges, but instead charged the closing account {$30.00} for an inspection fee, which was not requested, authorized, legitimate or required for any reason. In addition, the closing account was charged {$410.00} for "" funds owed by the borrower '', with no explanation of the charges. For years I have requested from shellpoint an explanation of the interest calculation and the formula used to calculate the monthly interest amount, but it was never provided by the servicer. shellpoint also withheld approximately {$8000.00} of unapplied payments for the last several months of the account. the account statement increased the loan balance by {$8000.00}. Which if I had not discovered this error would have been absorb into the loan cost. Over the term of this loan I believe some such errors were overlooked.

I make bi-weekly payments equal to one-half of my regular monthly mortgage payment, resulting in 26 half-payments per year ( 13 full payments annually ).

Shellpoint has repeatedly placed the additional bi-weekly payment in months with a third payment into an Unapplied Balance instead of applying it to principal, despite my clear intent that any funds in excess of the required monthly payment be applied to principal. 

For example : In XX/XX/XXXX, I made payments on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 

The third payment was not applied to principal and was instead placed into an Unapplied Balance.

Shellpoint representatives advised me that the funds would not be applied to principal unless I made yet another mortgage payment.

Shellpoint has advised me that the same will occur again in XX/XX/XXXX, when I make payments on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX the third payment will again be held as Unapplied Balance rather than applied to principal.

This practice is misleading and harmful. I am current on my mortgage, and Shellpoint is holding excess funds rather than applying them as a principal curtailment, despite no delinquency and despite my intent to reduce principal.

Holding borrower funds in suspense and refusing to apply excess payments to principal unless an additional future payment is made is improper servicing behavior and frustrates the borrowers right to make principal curtailments.

08/28/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","I am writing to you to request more clarification on the following actions of your company with respects to my loan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), following XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The following is a timeline of events. 
( 1 ) FEMA declared disaster on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I called to make the payment due XX/XX/XXXX and to ask what my options were for mortgage relief after a disaster. I was told because I was in a FEMA declared disaster zone, I can have 90 days forbearance, with no documentation required. Therefore, I proceeded to NOT make payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX due to the disaster forbearance plan that I was told by your representative that I will be placed in. Based on the information given, I was on disaster forbearance and my next payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. 
( XXXX ) According to Shellpoint documentation, it is confirmed that I called on XX/XX/XXXX to request disaster forbearance but it was indicated by my current point of contact, XXXX XXXX, that I was not actually documented as being in disaster forbearance. So my question is when it came time for this initial 90 day forbearance to end, was I documented as just delinquent for no FEMA declared event? Was XXXX XXXX notified that the reason for my delinquency was a disaster? Is it required for XXXX XXXX to be notified that I am in disaster forbearance? How did that affect the fees for property preservation? How did that affect the timeline of foreclosure? 
( XXXX ) In XX/XX/XXXX, before the initial disaster forbearance ended, I called Shellpoint and was given a loss mitigation point of contact, XXXX XXXX. I explained that I was displaced following the disaster and requested another 90 day extension of disaster forbearance. This representative listened to my hardship concerns caused by the disaster and said she will put me on a disaster forbearance plan for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. However she never mentioned that I was NOT on disaster forbearance already and should have been and she never mentioned that property preservation fees and inspections will soon begin. 
According to XXXX XXXX, disaster related forbearances must be coded properly. 
Was my forbearance reason coded properly for XXXX XXXX? It should have been coded with default code XXXX. It is important to code default reasons appropriately, according the XXXX XXXX, because this affects solicitations and foreclosure timelines. Does this also affect property preservation fees and the manner in which they can be assessed. 
According to Shellpoint mortgage servicers, I was referred to foreclosure on either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this is when {$1900.00} of legal fees was added to my total principal balance. At this point I had been delinquent for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, however, I made XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX because I knew my forbearance plan was ending and I intended to start regular payments. It seems very predatory and not acting in good faith to begin foreclosure proceedings and assess fees right after a disaster forbearance. 
According to the XXXX XXXX servicer guide, Shellpoint was required to seek approval before foreclosure. 
What are the legal fees for {$1900.00}. I am requesting documentation of this. When were these assessed and why? Why was forclosure started the day after my disaster forbearance? Was this because my reason for forbearance was not properly coded? 
-According to my POC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX property preservation began on my property In XXXX. I informed Shellpoint/Newrez , including the loss mitigation department, that my house became uninhabitable after XXXX XXXX and I was not living there. It took XXXX feet of floodwaters and I was finishing an opened home and flood insurance claim due to insured loss. Assessing exorbitant fees without my knowledge 3 months after a disaster is harmful to a consumer after loosing their house to a storm. I was taking care of the yard and was paying to have it mowed and edged at the same time as the asset management company, XXXX XXXX. I had made arrangements to remove a giant branch off of my roof, but was told by a tree servicer that it was not an immediate need. I am not sure the exact repairs and maintenance that was permitted to be done on my house but the fees were huge. I informed Shellpoint/Newrez that my plans were to sell the house as XXXX to either an investor who plans to remodel, or more so, I had more interest from builders that planned to knock down the house and XXXX. I explained that due to a FEMA regulation of not being able to permit more than 50 % of the value of your home. I had contractors calculate that this would be near impossible and suggested that my house is better for a knockdown. I was taking care of the property and accurately assessing how much repairs were necessary and worth the investment. Below are some of the most notable fees added to my total principal balance. 
Below is a link that puts limits to the amount of property preservation fees that Shellpoint can concur and pass on to me without notifying XXXX XXXX. I would like a detailed description of each activity that was done in order to make sure it fits in with these guidelines.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a formal Notice of Error / Qualified Written Request to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing via XXXX Certified Mail. I have attached proof of mailing, including the certified mail receipt and payment receipt. 

This Notice of Error disputed : The accuracy and validity of the alleged default Fees, charges, and advances assessed The loan accounting and payment history Shellpoint/NewRezs authority and standing to service and enforce the loan Despite receipt of this Notice of Error, Shellpoint/NewRez failed to acknowledge the notice within five ( 5 ) business days, as required by 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( d ), and failed to provide a substantive written response within thirty ( 30 ) business days, as required by law.

Instead of correcting the errors or responding substantively, Shellpoint/NewRez issued a Notice of Default dated XX/XX/XXXX, while the Notice of XXXX remained unresolved. This action was taken while federal servicing errors were pending, in violation of RESPA. 

Additional Background Original lender : XXXX XXXX XXXX  : XXXXaliber Home Loans Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing NewRez LLC I previously submitted a Qualified Written Request in XX/XX/XXXX and received only delay/extension letters through XX/XX/XXXX, without substantive resolution.

The draft was not reattempted. XXXX called into NewRez to rectify and was told she was all set. No late payment was applied. 
Unbeknownst to the borrowers, the additional principal that they had regularly scheduled was held in a partial payment account and was not released to cover the payment until XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX called New Rez several times in XXXX and was assured she was up to date, and even had an overage. 
Summary of Events : The XX/XX/XXXX draft was initiated but returned NSF. This is 100 % the fault of the XXXX, who fixed it immediately. 
The following day, additional funds were deposited into the account. 
The borrower called NewRez and spoke with a representative, who confirmed she was all set and that no further action was needed. 
Despite that, NewRez did not re-draft or manually process the XXXX payment. 
The system then took {$120.00} and applied it as a partial payment, leaving the XXXX installment showing as unpaid. 
Because of this, the account now incorrectly reflects that payments are XXXX month behind, extending the payoff date and impacting credit reporting. 
The continual {$120.00} was placed in a partial account until it was fully applied, on XX/XX/XXXX. 
As the payment is on auto-draft and no calls were made to the borrower, she was unaware of the depth of the issue. 
Requested Actions : It is clear from the NewRez notes and on time auto payments that this was an error, yet it has far reaching consequences. 

Conduct a full payment research investigation of the XX/XX/XXXX NSF return and the subsequent partial application ( {$120.00} ). 
Correct the payment history to reflect that the borrower called, resolved the NSF issue, and was told the account was current. Please note that she also called in XXXX as well.

11/08/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"CFPB Complaint Servicer Identity Confusion and Regulatory Non-Response Complainant : XXXX XXXX Loan Number : Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TN XXXX Servicer ( s ) Named : NewRez LLC / Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Date : XX/XX/XXXX Point 1 : 1 Summary of the Problem My mortgage account is being presented under three different company XXXX XXXX XXXX, NewRez LLC, and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicingcreating confusion about who is legally responsible for servicing, error correction, and RESPA compliance. 
When I log into myaccount.newrez.com, it authenticates as NewRez but immediately redirects me to a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing dashboard that displays the same loan information. 
My billing statements, notices, and letters all carry the Shellpoint logo, while the website footer and licensing information identify NewRez LLC as the legal servicer. 
When I file CFPB complaints against NewRez, I receive only generic form letters from Shellpoint that do not address the specific regulatory violations raised. 

This structure leaves meand other borrowersunable to determine which company is accountable under federal law. 



2 Background Facts 1. Payments made in XX/XX/XXXX were misapplied or held in unapplied funds. 
2. I submitted several Notices of Error directly naming NewRez LLC as the servicer.

3. Every reply has come from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing with language such as Thank you for contacting us ; your concern has been forwarded to the appropriate department. 
None of the replies include the statutory acknowledgment or findings required by 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ). 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, in its SEC filings, lists NewRez LLC ( and therefore Shellpoint ) as a wholly owned subsidiary, yet XXXX has previously responded to CFPB complaints by saying wrong company. 



3 Why This Matters Federal law allows only one servicer of record. Using multiple brand names fragments accountability and prevents borrowers from receiving proper statutory responses. 
The result is : No valid acknowledgment of Notices of Error. 
Contradictory account information between the NewRez and Shellpoint portals. 
Consumer confusion as to where to send payments, disputes, and legal correspondence. 

This pattern may constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice under 12 U.S.C. 5531 and a violation of 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 11 ) ( other errors ).

4 Requested Action 1. The CFPB should require NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and parent XXXX XXXX XXXX to clarify in writing which legal entity is responsible for RESPA and Regulation X compliance.

2. Compel the servicer to provide a single point of contact and a full written investigation report addressing the errors previously submitted.

3. Examine whether the use of dual brand identities ( NewRez / Shellpoint ) constitutes a deceptive practice that impairs borrower rights.

4. Order correction of account balances, removal of any false delinquency entries, and full reconciliation of unapplied funds.

5 Attachments ( Recommended Exhibits ) Exhibit A : Screenshot of NewRez login page showing redirect to Shellpoint. 
Exhibit B : Copy of a CFPB complaint filed under NewRez LLC. 
Exhibit C : Customer Service form letter reply on Shellpoint letterhead. 
Exhibit D : Excerpt from XXXX XXXX XXXX  filing listing NewRez LLC as a wholly owned subsidiary. 



6 Complainant Statement Because these entities share data systems and corporate ownership, they should be treated as one servicer for regulatory purposes. Their current structure prevents meaningful error correction and causes continuing financial and credit harm. I request that the CFPB and state regulators require unified oversight and direct accountability from NewRez LLC / Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 


Exhibit E Proof of Servicer Identity Mismatch Description : Attached envelope received XX/XX/XXXX from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, addressed to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX. 

Significance : 1. Mailing Origin vs. Legal Servicer The envelope bears the Shellpoint brand and XXXX XXXX, XXXX  return address, yet the borrowers online account is hosted at myaccount.newrez.com, listing NewRez LLC as the servicer of record. 
2. Evidence of Dual Branding This demonstrates that NewRez and Shellpoint are operating a single servicing platform under two separate public identities. 
3. Consumer Confusion & Regulatory Conflict Borrowers are instructed to correspond with Shellpoint while their mortgage note, RESPA rights, and CFPB complaint filings are legally directed to NewRez LLC. This disconnect obstructs proper dispute resolution and misleads consumers about the responsible entity. 
4. Regulatory Implication : Under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 11 ) ( other errors ) and 1024.38 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( vi ), the servicer must clearly disclose its legal name and ensure accurate borrower communications. Using a trade name without disclosure of the underlying servicer violates both provisions and has been cited in CFPB v. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) as deceptive and misleading. 



I have attached an envelope showing that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing corresponds with me, although my online account is under NewRez LLC. This proves that the same loan is being managed and communicated through two brand identities. Borrowers can not tell who the actual servicer is or where to direct RESPA notices. The enclosed mail piece establishes that NewRez LLC and Shellpoint are one and the same operation under XXXX XXXX, and this dual branding should be investigated as a deceptive servicing practice. 

Complaint Point 2 : 1. The Corporate Structure and Concealment Mechanism XXXX XXXX XXXX is the publicly traded parent company. 
NewRez LLC is XXXX wholly owned mortgage subsidiary the licensed servicer of record that holds the contractual and regulatory duties under RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) and Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ). 
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is not a separate entity ; it is simply a trade name or doing business as division of NewRez LLC. 

However, consumers are rarely told this. Each brandXXXX NewRez, and Shellpointpresents itself as distinct. This fragmentation allows the same corporate group to shift responsibility among its own layers, producing the illusion that one company ( XXXX ) is only a holding company, another ( NewRez ) is a wholesaler, and a third ( Shellpoint ) is the servicer. 

The truth, documented in XXXX SEC  filings, is that all three operate as one integrated servicing enterprise. XXXX consolidates all revenue, risk, and operations of NewRez ( and therefore Shellpoint ) in its quarterly and annual reports. When consumers file complaints, XXXX legal team can respond wrong company, while NewRez funnels correspondence through Shellpoints customer-service portal. The result is a self-reinforcing system of misdirection. 



2. Why This Matters Under Federal Law This layered branding scheme directly interferes with the consumers federally protected rights : Violation of the Servicer-of-Record Requirement : Under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ), the servicer of record must acknowledge and resolve Notices of Error. When NewRez delegates responses to Shellpoint, it circumvents that requirement and denies the borrower a compliant written determination. 
False and Misleading Communication : The Consumer Financial Protection Act ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ) prohibits deceptive acts or practices. Communicating through a different brand while legally acting as NewRez creates confusion about who is accountable and frustrates a borrowers ability to obtain relief. 
Failure of Oversight by the Parent Company : Because XXXX certifies the integrity of NewRezs servicing operations in its SEC filings, repeated misapplications of funds and non-responses to CFPB complaints constitute evidence of parent-level control failure and potential material misrepresentation to investors. 



3. The Practical Impact on Consumers This structure creates a three-layered vacuum of accountability : 1. Borrower Confusion : Homeowners trying to resolve errors or apply unapplied funds receive form letters from Shellpoint that never mention NewRezs compliance obligations or XXXX ownership. Most borrowers have no idea which entity holds legal responsibility. 
2. Regulatory Evasion : Each brand can deny knowledge : Shellpoint claims its only the servicer. 
NewRez claims Shellpoint handled the response. 
XXXX claims its the wrong company. 
The complaint then circulates indefinitely without a proper statutory answer, defeating the purpose of RESPAs 30-day correction requirement. 
3. Financial Harm : Payments are often misapplied or trapped in unapplied funds accounts, producing artificial delinquency, negative credit reporting, and unwarranted fees. In this case, over {$100000.00} in unapplied funds and {$5000.00} in false past-due amounts are evidence of direct economic and reputational injury. 
4. Systemic Market Risk : When a parent company consolidates billions in servicing assets yet denies responsibility for its own subsidiarys compliance failures, both investors and consumers are relying on distorted disclosures. This undermines trust in the integrity of mortgage-servicing data used in securitizations and risk assessments. 



4. Broader Consumer Protection Significance The CFPB and state regulators have repeatedly sanctioned servicers for similar fragmentation tactics ( CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; In re XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). Those cases established that a parent company can not outsource or rebrand its way out of statutory duties. Consumers must have a single, accountable servicer of record. 

Here, the XXXXNewRezShellpoint chain converts that principle into a maze that ordinary borrowers can not navigate, effectively nullifying RESPAs protections through corporate opacity. 

To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions ( TNDFI ) CC : NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Subject : Demand for Immediate Federal and State Intervention Coercive Threats, Extortion, and Systemic Misapplication of Funds by NewRez LLC / Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Executive Summary This complaint establishes that NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX knowingly maintained over {$100000.00} in unapplied funds while continuing to post false delinquency notices and demand payment already satisfied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, a Shellpoint representative confirmed in a recorded call that approximately {$12000.00} in unapplied payments existed. Subsequent review revealed the true amount approaches {$100000.00}, spanning multiple periods. Despite this knowledge, the company issued collection-style communications and portal alerts warning of payment default and possible foreclosure. 

Such actions constitute coercive extortion and financial intimidation, violating multiple federal statutes and regulations governing mortgage servicing integrity. 



Key Evidence 1. Confirmed Payments ( Exhibits AB ) : XX/XX/XXXX : {$3900.00} posted from XXXX XXXX XXXX Acct # XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$750.00} posted from same account. 
Both transactions cleared the consumers bank and were accepted by Shellpoints system. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( Exhibit C ) : Agent confirmed we currently show around XXXX XXXX in unapplied funds and that payments may be in suspense awaiting manual release. 
Follow-up supervisor call revealed internal audit identified significantly more unapplied fundsnear XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars. 
XXXX. Threat and Extortion Pattern ( Exhibits XXXX ) : Despite these admissions, Shellpoint issued late-fee postings, delinquency alerts, and payment threats via portal and email, demanding immediate payment under risk of foreclosure. 
This occurred after proof of payment had been verified and unapplied funds were acknowledged internally. 
XXXX. Systemic Ledger Manipulation ( Exhibits XXXX ) : Dual portals ( NewRez vs Shellpoint ) show identical loan number XXXX but conflicting balances. 
Escrow listed as {$2700.00} since XX/XX/XXXX with no correction. 
Late fees ( {$1000.00} ) and Other Fees ( {$75.00} ) imposed without missed payments. 



Violations 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) Failure to credit payments as of date received.

12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) Failure to correct servicing error after notice.

12 C.F.R. 1024.36 ( d ) Failure to provide complete accounting upon request.

12 U.S.C. 5531 and 5536 Unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices.

18 U.S.C. 1344 ( Bank Fraud ) Execution of a scheme to defraud by manipulating financial records.

18 U.S.C. 875 ( d ) Extortion through threat of financial harm to obtain additional payments.

Interpretation Once NewRez confirmed the existence of unapplied funds, any continued billing, late-fee imposition, or threat of foreclosure ceased to be administrative error. It became intentional coercion, leveraging false delinquency to compel duplicate payments. 
This conduct mirrors the predicate acts recognized in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ( extortion via financial coercion ) and XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( payment misapplication violating RESPA ). 

The internal segregation of payments into unapplied/suspense accounts while simultaneously demanding further payment constitutes a dual-ledger enrichment mechanism : consumers pay twice, while servicer balance sheets inflate escrow deficits for revenue recognition under XXXX XXXX consolidated reporting. 



Requested Relief and Action 1. Immediate CFPB and TNDFI enforcement audit of NewRez/Shellpoint servicing operations. 
2. Cease-and-desist order against further collection or threat communications on XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX. Mandatory application of all unapplied funds to principal and interest as of original receipt dates. 
XXXX. Refund of improper fees and charges ( total {$1000.00} plus interest ). 
XXXX. Written ledger audit and servicing history under 12 C.F.R. 1024.36 ( d ) ( 2 ). 
XXXX. Referral to the Department of Justice for review of potential violations of 18 U.S.C. 1344 and 875 ( d ). 
XXXX. Compensatory damages of {$100000.00} for withheld funds and {>= $1,000,000} for emotional, psychological, and financial harm caused by coercive threat and public credit risk. 



Conclusion NewRez LLC and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing intentionally used false delinquency threats to extract additional payments after acknowledging the existence of unapplied funds exceeding {$100000.00}. This constitutes systemic fraud and extortion within the meaning of federal law and demands immediate multi-agency enforcement.

Background and Timeline : XX/XX/XXXX : My home sustained significant fire damage. 

XX/XX/XXXX : My insurance company issued a check in the amount of {$30000.00}, payable to XXXX XXXX & NewRez, for fire mitigation services only. These funds were to be redistributed to XXXX XXXX, who handled the cleanup, dehumidification, air scrubbing, and odor removal required after the fire. 

XX/XX/XXXX : A second check in the amount of {$9700.00}, payable to XXXX XXXX & NewRez, was issued as a deposit for the mitigation services. This check took approximately five weeks to process through NewRez before I could release payment to XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Two additional checks were issued in the amounts of {$21000.00} and {$7000.00}, also payable to XXXX XXXX & NewRez, for the rebuild and repair work to restore my home. These funds are specifically designated for construction and repair not mitigation. 

Despite repeated contact from both myself and XXXX XXXX, these repair funds have not been released. We have received conflicting information from the Loss Drafts Department, and at this point, the delay is severely hindering our ability to begin necessary reconstruction. 

Issues Encountered : NewRez is requiring a materials list for the rebuild, which my contractor advises is not a standard requirement with other mortgage companies. 

NewRez has stated that it must approve the materials list, though this process appears inconsistent with standard industry or insurance procedures. 

NewRez has refused to release any of the repair funds, claiming that the mitigation payments should have been used for the rebuild. However, the mitigation and rebuild are two separate parts of the claim, each with distinct scopes of work and corresponding insurance payouts. The mitigation claim, totaling {$30000.00}, was paid over a year ago and is fully closed. 

At this point, NewRez is withholding funds issued by my insurance company to repair their secured asset. This delay has left my family unable to restore our home, and we are now facing exposure to harsh winter conditions in Massachusetts. 

I respectfully request that NewRez release the repair funds immediately or provide written clarification as to the specific documentation or steps required to do so. Please confirm receipt of this message as I would like to launch a form complaint against NEWrez LLC.

12/16/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Paying off the loan,"I am the borrower and signer on the note for this mortgage. No third party is involved. 

Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing / NewRez refused and mishandled multiple payment attempts while my loan was under review for modification and servicing resolution from XXXX through XXXX. Payments were not properly accepted or applied, and the servicing process was delayed and mishandled. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, this loan was fully paid off through a refinance. Shellpoint/NewRez accepted the payoff funds, which legally satisfied and closed the loan. 

Despite acceptance of full payoff, the company failed to properly apply the payoff, failed to close the account, and failed to update the loan status. The mortgage continues to be treated and reported as active and severely delinquent after payoff. 

I requested confirmation of payoff, account closure, and correction of servicing and reporting errors. The company has failed to provide this information and has instead responded to prior CFPB complaints by falsely claiming there is an unauthorized third party, which is untrue. 

As a direct result of this post-payoff servicing failure, inaccurate account handling, and failure to correct errors, I have been unable to complete refinancing, access credit, or pursue legitimate financing opportunities. This ongoing harm is caused solely by the companys failure to properly process payoff and close the loan.

There was no discussion during this call or at any other time about our credit getting destroyed. We would have been able to catch the loan up in full if notified/requested, but that never happened.

During our hardship, we proactively reached out to both mortgaging servicers to make sure everyone was kept in the loop during major events such as the home fire, and periodically throughout, we answered when they contacted us, and when they told us the forbearance was over and a new agreement and payment was required, we did it. In short, we did everything asked of us and then some, yet we have still been unfairly punished by Shellpoint.

Dear XXXX XXXX : This letter serves to document that on XXXX Complainant ( XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing to render a monthly mortgage payment in the amount of {$870.00}, which is the mortgage contract amount that was established by "" Rocket Mortgage '' prior to the mortgage being allegedly purchased by XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Indenture Trustee XXXX 

This writer spoke with a rude, unprofessional individual that identified himself as XXXX XXXX from the Loss Mitigation XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated that this writer is "" XXXX ( XXXX ) months in arrears and owes {$3400.00} USD. The individual appeared to be staging a scene and then asked "" why is XXXX XXXX in XXXX month 's arrear, does XXXX XXXX live in the property and wishes to retain the property. '' This writer inquired "" who is XXXX XXXX, what is the individual 's title, to which XXXX XXXX stated that he was a "" Loss Mitigation XXXX. '' This writer informed that XXXX called to render his monthly payment, advised "" XXXX '' that he is an in appropriate party to be engaging in this staged dialogue and XXXX XXXX stated that he is not accepting XXXX XXXX 
XXXX 's payment and he is now late. 

XXXX XXXX inquired if XXXX XXXX can document in writing the relevant reasoning for denying XXXX XXXX 's mortgage payment, how he arrived at the mortgage arrears of {$3400.00}, and also inquired why did Shellpoint deceptively misrepresent that XXXX XXXX agreed to a "" Tax Recert '' and inquired what a "" tax recert '' is and can that information be documented in writing. The alleged loss mitigation ( XXXX XXXX ) stated that he will not document anything, nor will Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, and he will document his notes as he sees fit. ( The law is clear that a mortgage servicer can not change the terms of a mortgage loan. XXXX XXXX 's loan was originated by "" XXXX Mortgage, which is a subsidiary to XXXX XXXX '' ). Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing only services the loan and has no legal authority to do anything else. Claimant requested that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing can provide whatever legal documentation it can provide to factually show otherwise and Shellpoint have not provided the requested documentation to show legal authority to change the mortgage terms for a mortgage loan that was not originated by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. 

XXXX XXXX 's statement, which was allegedly on a tape recorded line suggest that he intends to fabricate information suit the circumstances of our brief conversation. 
The scenario that unfolded today have previously occurred this past XX/XX/XXXX, when Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing failed to accept XXXX XXXX 's mortgage payment, then fraudulently reported in pretext to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 's that XXXX XXXX was 30 days late. 

For the record, this writer will forward by mail his payment for XXXX in the amount of {$870.00}. The relevant facts will establish that XXXX XXXX have previously documented that he will pay his own property taxes when they become due in XX/XX/XXXX. 
The relevant record will establish that XXXX XXXX has a XXXX balance property tax and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing fraudulently represented this past XX/XX/XXXX that a property tax payment in the amount of {$1300.00} would be paid by Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing. This writer informed in writing this past XX/XX/XXXX that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing 's false representation of offering to pay {$1300.00} in a false property tax payment is tantamount to extortion, when a false payment is to be used to justify false fees under the pretext of paying property taxes, when nothing is owed. 

This type of abuse, harassment from an alleged ignorant loss mitigation XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) is unsettling and will not be tolerated, hence this letter serves to document the facts, and this writer is requesting that Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing make available recorded telephone conversation dated XXXX between XXXX XXXX and the individual who represents himself to be ( XXXX XXXX ). 

XXXX XXXX 's mortgage payment should have been accepted and "" XXXX 's '' behavior shows retaliatory, disreputable activity in violation of the Consumer Protection Code Section XXXX et seq., along with charges for mortgage lender misconduct, deceptive banking practices, alleged misrepresentation of loan terms that includes unfair or deceptive acts or practices ( UDAAP ). 

This Writer is not in arrears for {$3400.00}. This is a fabricated figure. This Writer should have a minimum XXXX XXXX of {$2.00}, XXXX.

11/11/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"I. Core Event XX/XX/XXXX Admission On XX/XX/XXXX, a NewRez/Shellpoint agent admitted on a recorded call that {$12000.00} of borrower payments were unapplied and promised allocation of {$8000.00} toward XXXX and XXXX payments with a {$4000.00} refund. 
This admission, verified by recording and transaction data, was never honored. Subsequent calls produced contradictory statements, new totals, and later a written response blaming agent error. 

That reversal confirms the existence of no functioning control systema total collapse of governance and supervision throughout NewRez, Shellpoint, and by extension, their parent, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 



XXXX. Pattern of Misrepresentation and Internal Disorder Across XXXX recorded calls, agents delivered mutually exclusive statements regarding balance, payment posting, and unapplied funds. 
Each agent quoted a different total for the same due date. 
Confirmed ACH drafts were not reflected in ledgers. 
Payment application tasks were promised, opened, and never executed. 
Portal balances shifted within XXXX hours without explanation. 

These inconsistencies demonstrate systemic control failure, not clerical error. The later claim that our agent made a mistake merely concedes that the company lacks any internal consistency or compliance supervision. 



XXXX. Legal Violations 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) Failure to credit payments as of the date received.

12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) Failure to correct acknowledged servicing errors.

12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ) Continuation of collection/foreclosure during active dispute. 
Each violation multiplied by every misapplied payment constitutes a regulatory offense. 



IV. Fiduciary Oversight and Corporate Governance Failure A. Applicable Standards XXXX. In re XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. Ch. XXXX ) XXXX duty to implement and monitor information systems ; knowing failure = bad-faith oversight. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX ) Directors must monitor mission-critical risks ; ignorance equals loyalty breach.

XXXX. Regulatory notification to CFPB and XXXX within XXXX business days outlining corrective plan. 

Understand, State Regulators are already involved and have stated they have pulled all CFPB Complaints to move. 



XXXX. Closing NewRezs claim that an agent made an error is an admission that no one within XXXX mortgage-servicing empire knows where borrower funds reside. 
Such ignorancepermitted and perpetuated by senior officersconstitutes reckless, bad-faith governance under XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. 
Until XXXX delivers a verified ledger and issues full restitution, it remains in active breach of fiduciary duty and federal law. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, Tennessee Addendum Rebuttal of NewRezs XX/XX/XXXX Dispute After acknowledging on XX/XX/XXXX that {$12000.00} of borrower funds were being held unapplied, NewRez/Shellpoint later reversed course and submitted a written statement claiming that its own agent had made an error. 
That reversal can not withstand factual scrutiny : XXXX. Verifiable Recording. The call is preserved in full. The agent confirmed specific dollar amounts {$8000.00} will be applied, and {$4000.00} refunded. Those numbers match contemporaneous ledger values visible in the borrower portal. 
XXXX. System Synchronization. Within XXXX hours of that call, the transaction history displayed corresponding task completed entries and the unapplied-funds total declined to {$0.00}. That digital signature proves the company itself executed changes consistent with the agents promise. 
XXXX. Subsequent Contradictions. XXXX later representatives ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) referenced completed tasks or unapplied balances without noting any correction, demonstrating that no single internal record source exists. 
XXXX. Failure to Preserve Evidence. When confronted, NewRez produced no internal ticket number, supervisor review note, or quality-assurance record. Under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( c ), servicers must retain evidence of investigations into asserted errors ; failure to do so confirms non-compliance. 
XXXX. Constructive Knowledge. By invoking agent error without reviewing the underlying ledger event or recording, management acted with reckless disregard of the truthprecisely the XXXX definition of bad-faith oversight.

Therefore, the agent error defense is affirmative evidence of a cover-up : it proves that NewRezs internal systems permit unverified, retroactive alteration of financial data. The reversal transformed a documented, verifiable correction into a false narrative to evade liability. That act converts operational negligence into knowing misrepresentation.

This momentXXXX XXXX followed by the written denialmarks the precise breach point where : NewRezs internal controls failed ; Rithm Capitals governance obligations under XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX attached ; and Executive certifications under XXXX XXXX & XXXX became unreliable.

This notice is being submitted because you caused a prior RESPA Notice of Error to be closed as a duplicate without providing the investigation, written findings, and corrections required by Regulation X. I never received a compliant written response as required by 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) and 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ).

Instead of providing a substantive written response with findings and corrections as required by 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ), you caused the RESPA notice to be treated as a duplicate. That is not a permissible way to avoid your duties under RESPA and Regulation X. 

Your failure to provide a proper response is itself an independent and ongoing error under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 11 ) ( failure to provide accurate information regarding the servicing of a mortgage loan ) and 1024.35 ( e ) ( failure to investigate and respond ).

Misapplication of Payments & Illegal Use of Unapplied Funds/ Suspense Your XXXX letter admits that, beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, you : placed multiple full payments ( e.g., {$1000.00}, {$2000.00}, {$3000.00}, {$4000.00} ) into unapplied status, combined unapplied funds with later payments to create full payments, reversed posted payments ( for example, the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments ) and moved them back into unapplied, leaving the loan artificially delinquent, and applied funds first to fees rather than in the required order of principal, interest, and escrow. 

These practices constitute payment application errors and failure to apply payments to principal, interest, and escrow under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( i ) ( ii ) and violate 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( k ) ( 1 ) ( C ). 

Relevant authority includes, for example : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX ) ( servicer liability for failure to apply payments and issuing false default notices ). 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ( unapplied funds as RESPA violation ). 
XXXX XXXX NewRez LLC, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( D.N.M. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) ( NewRez liability for mishandling suspense accounts and misleading borrowers ). 
XXXX v. NewRez LLC, No. XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX XXXX ) ( sufficient facts pled where NewRez failed to properly credit payments under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ). 

XXXX. False Default, False Delinquency, and Threat of Foreclosure You issued an XX/XX/XXXX Pre-Foreclosure Notice demanding approximately {$14000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX to avoid foreclosure. 
On an XX/XX/XXXX recorded call, your own agent admitted that the actual amount due was only {$750.00} and that approximately {$12000.00} was being held in unapplied funds. 
Your XXXX letter confirms that multiple payments were sitting in unapplied status rather than properly applied. 

Issuing a foreclosure threat and default notice under these conditions : violates 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ) & ( b ) ( 2 ), constitutes false representation of the amount and status of a debt under 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ) and 1692e ( 5 ) ( FDCPA ), and is an unfair and deceptive act or practice under 12 U.S.C. 5531 & 5536 ( Dodd-Frank UDAAP ). 

XXXX. Improper & Unauthorized Inspection Fees Your XXXX letter discloses at least XXXX property inspection fees ( e.g., {$25.00} on or about XX/XX/XXXX and another on XX/XX/XXXX ), as well as additional inspection costs. 

Because the delinquency reflected on your system is itself manufactured by mishandled payments and unapplied funds, these inspection fees were : not expressly authorized by the agreement nor permitted by law, violating 15 U.S.C. 1692f ( 1 ) ( FDCPA ), and unfair and abusive under 12 U.S.C. 5531, because they stem from your own accounting misconduct. 

XXXX. Escrow Mismanagement & Shortage Calculation Errors Your letter asserts an escrow shortage and explains that escrow was adjusted to recover that shortage. However : my escrow account shows inconsistent balances and unexplained debits, taxes and insurance were fully paid and current, and you removed or reclassified funds in a way that can not be reconciled with a normal escrow analysis under 12 C.F.R. 1024.17.

This is an escrow account error under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 3 ) and a violation of 1024.17 ( k ). 

XXXX. Incorrect Credit Reporting & Failure to Correct You reported derogatory information to consumer reporting agencies consistent with your manufactured delinquency. Once notified of your servicing errors and provided with call recordings and evidence, you failed to : correct the reporting, or conduct a reasonable investigation. 

This is : a servicing error under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ), and a violation of 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) & ( b ) ( FCRA ) once you received disputes via CFPB/TNDFI and directly from me. 

XXXX. Misrepresentations to Regulators and Investors Your written responses to CFPB and to XXXX, along with your wrong company replies in multiple CFPB complaints, are inconsistent with : your XXXX  letter confirming that NewRez XXXX Shellpoint services my VA loan, and public statements by XXXX XXXX XXXX and NewRez leadership acknowledging the relationship between XXXX, NewRez, and Shellpoint. 

Providing conflicting descriptions of ownership, servicing responsibility, and ledger accuracy to regulators while continuing collection activity is : a servicing error under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 11 ), a deceptive practice under 12 U.S.C. 5531 & 5536, and relevant to potential securities issues under SEC Rule 10b-5, as it masks material servicing deficiencies from investors and regulators. 

XXXX. Pattern or Practice of Noncompliance & Imminent Harm to Others Your refusal to correct acknowledged errors, your written admission of incorrect information in the XX/XX/XXXX quote, and your categorical decline to adjust or refund misapplied funds demonstrate a pattern or practice of noncompliance under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) ( 1 ) ( B ).

Because you service a large VA loan portfolio, your ongoing conduct : places other VA borrowers at risk of false delinquency and wrongful foreclosure, exposes veterans and their families to unlawful fees and credit damage, and raises systemic concerns squarely within the enforcement jurisdiction of CFPB, VA, HUD, state regulators, and, for XXXX XXXX, the SEC and other market regulators. 



IV. Requested Investigation & Corrections ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ) ) Pursuant to 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ), this Notice of Error requires you to conduct a reasonable investigation and, within XXXX business days of receipt, either : correct the errors and provide written confirmation, or provide a written notice explaining, with supporting documents, why you contend no error occurred. 

I specifically demand the following corrective actions : XXXX. Full Ledger Reconstruction Provide a written, transaction-level reconstruction of my account from XX/XX/XXXX to present, showing for each transaction : date, amount, source ( check/ACH ), how it was applied ( principal/interest/escrow/fees ), and any period it sat in unapplied/suspense. 
XXXX. Proper Application of All Funds Apply all payments and unapplied amounts in accordance with the note, deed of trust, VA servicing requirements, and 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 1 ). 
Remove any improper late fees and inspection fees that stem from your own servicing errors. 
XXXX. Rescission of False Delinquency & Foreclosure Activity Issue a written rescission of the XX/XX/XXXX Pre-Foreclosure Notice and any other default or acceleration notices based on inaccurate ledger data. 
Confirm that no foreclosure activity, attorney referral, or trustee action is pending or will be pursued until all errors are fully corrected. 
XXXX. Escrow Re-Analysis and Correction Conduct a compliant escrow analysis under 12 C.F.R. 1024.17, using corrected payment history and disbursements, and provide the full analysis in writing. 
Correct any negative escrow created by your misapplication of funds. 
XXXX Credit Reporting Corrections Immediately correct all negative credit reporting linked to manufactured delinquency and furnish updated data to all CRAs, consistent with FCRA and Regulation V, and provide me written confirmation of each CRA notified. 
XXXX. Written Policy & Investor Disclosure Identify in writing the current investor/owner of the loan, any XXXX pool information, and the Rithm-affiliated entity that ultimately benefits from servicing revenue. 
Produce the written policy or guidelines you relied on for : placing payments into unapplied status, reversing posted payments, and initiating property inspections and fees. 
XXXX. Systemic Safeguards & Veterans Harm Describe what steps you are taking to audit other VA loans where unapplied funds, reversed payments, or false delinquency may have occurred. 
Confirm that similar errors affecting other borrowers will be corrected and that wrongful foreclosures will be halted. 



XXXX Notice of Regulatory & Litigation Rights Your decision to treat my prior RESPA Notice of Error as a duplicate instead of providing a lawful response is now part of the record of willful noncompliance. This renewed Notice is intended to : demonstrate to regulators your deliberate disregard of federal law, preserve my rights under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) ( actual, statutory, and pattern or practice damages plus attorneys fees ), preserve my rights under FDCPA, FCRA, Dodd-Frank UDAAP , Tennessee law , and VA-related protections , and provide a clear documentary trail for CFPB, XXXX, VA, HUD, and any court. 

Nothing in this letter should be construed as a waiver of any claim, remedy, or protection. I expressly reserve all rights.

08/15/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Investigation took more than 30 days,"In XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage was transferred to Shellpoint/NewRez. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from them claiming my XXXX payment had not been received. My mortgage payments are made automatically each month, so I immediately checked my bank account. The records showed my {$3000.00} payment was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and deposited by Shellpoint/NewRez on XX/XX/XXXX. I printed the proof of payment from my bank. 

After hours on the phone, I was transferred to a supervisor who confirmed my payment was misapplied to principal only. She gave me a case number and assured me she would fix the error. However, days later, I received notice that Shellpoint/NewRez had reported me XXXX days late to the credit bureaus. My credit scores dropped sharply. 

Over the next XXXX months, I contacted XXXX more than XXXX times to request correction of this false reporting. Many calls ended in long holds, disconnections, and repeated requests to start over because they claimed they had no record of prior cases. I have recorded the calls, documented case numbers, and kept detailed notes of the calls and actions Ive taken. 

Although XXXX corrected the posting internally in XX/XX/XXXX, they never corrected the false reporting to the credit bureaus. I sent them a signed demand letter on XX/XX/XXXX with proof of payment, case numbers, and employee names. They did not respond. On XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX Department agent emailed me a XXXX XXXX XXXX clearly showing the payment was received on time, misapplied, and later corrected. 

I sent that proof to the credit bureaus, but they investigated the wrong account a mortgage I sold XXXX years ago. The false late mark remains, damaging my credit for nearly a year. This has significantly increased my mortgage and auto loan interest rates and insurance premiums, costing me hundreds of dollars each month. 

The lender I am currently working with for a new loan has confirmed that if XXXX provides me with a signed letter on company letterhead explaining the error, detailing how the XX/XX/XXXX payment was misapplied, and confirming that my account was current for that period, they can initiate a rapid rescore. This would allow my pending loans to close at preferred interest rates rather than the significantly higher rates I am facing now due to XXXX XXXX XXXX to the credit bureaus. 

As a furnisher under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, XXXX is required to correct inaccurate reporting within XXXX days of becoming aware of it. They have had proof since XX/XX/XXXX, yet have knowingly continued reporting false information for almost a year.

As of the effective date of myXX/XX/XXXX policy, I have active homeowners insurance coverage that meets your mortgage requirements. Proof of this coverage, including the declarations page and policy number, has already been provided to your office. 
Despite this, Shellpoint has continued to bill me for the prior force-placed insurance, stating that I must continue paying for the remaining XX/XX/XXXX months of that {$5000.00} policy in addition to my XXXX premium. This is not permitted under RESPA ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX ), which requires a servicer to cancel and refund any overlapping or duplicative coverage once valid proof of insurance is provided. 
Accordingly, I am requesting the following actions : XXXX. Immediate cancellation of the force-placed insurance policy. 
XXXX. Refund or credit for any premiums charged after my XX/XX/XXXX policy became effective. 
XXXX. Written confirmation that my escrow account and monthly payments will be adjusted to reflect only my active XXXX coverage.

I have repeatedly offered and authorized immediate payment of my past due regular monthly installments for XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/year>, totaling {$9900.00}. My payment instruction was timely and explicit ( XX/XX/year> ), with sufficient funds available for payment. Nonetheless, Shellpoint failed to process the payment due to internal administrative errors ( absence of assigned staff ), not due to any delay, refusal, or inability on my part. 

In addition, Shellpoint is demanding "" default interest '' in the excessive amount of {$26000.00} for a principal arrearage of {$9900.00} over less than three months.

This demand : Exceeds contractual and statutory limits : The Promissory Note ( Section H ) sets a default interest rate cap at 18 % per annum, and per Florida Statutes 687.03 et seq., all interest, fees, or penalties beyond statutory limits are void.

Raises serious compliance concerns : The mathematically correct and legally permissible default interest would be approximately {$440.00} for the arrearage periodnot over {$26000.00}.

Despite numerous formal written requests, Shellpoint has : Failed to provide the detailed, period-by-period, itemized breakdown of the alleged default interest ( as required under 12 CFR 1024.35 ).

Failed to provide written confirmation of unconditional payment acceptance and account status correction.

Continued foreclosure proceedings and adverse actions, conditioned payment acceptance on irrelevant requirements ( e.g., "" hardship application '' ) despite my ability and readiness to pay immediately. 

It appears Shellpoint has violated multiple CFPB/RESPA requirements, as well as Florida state law on usurious interest practices.

Requested Solution : I request the following : Immediate acceptance of my full past due payment of {$9900.00} and restoration of my account to current status.

Immediate suspension of all adverse actions ( including foreclosure and negative credit reporting ).

Complete reversal of unlawfully assessed charges, fees, and excessive default interest.

Provision of a detailed, period-by-period breakdown and legal basis for any interest, fees, or charges imposed.

Oversight and enforcement action by CFPB to ensure compliance with RESPA, TILA, and state law.

My issues I have been seeking to resolve are : A {$140.00} deduction from my escrow account was made without explanation. 
My PMI payment is being deducted after my monthly payment posts, which causes confusion in accounting and payment tracking. 
My monthly mortgage payment amount changes nearly every month without clear explanation or consistency, making it difficult to budget or plan. 
Last year the servicer failed to deduct my monthly PMI payments entirely, and instead charged me in one lump sum, creating a large negative balance in my escrow account that I am still trying to recover from. There was little explanation and no accountability for the mistake. 
When I made an additional escrow payment by phone, I clearly instructed that it be applied to escrow. Instead, it was misapplied to principal. While this was eventually corrected, it shows poor handling of payment instructions. 
I have also had ongoing issues with my homeowners insurance.

10/12/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Applying for or obtaining a modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or deed-in-lieu","My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am the homeowner and borrower of record for my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX. 

In XXXX, while I was in an active XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  , Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing / NewRez demanded {$10000.00} from me even though they were already receiving my regular mortgage payments through my bankruptcy trustee. This collection attempt happened during a period when I was under bankruptcy court protection and Shellpoint was prohibited from billing me directly or demanding any separate payments outside of the court-approved plan. 

Later, in XXXX, while I was still in bankruptcy, Shellpoint/NewRez added extra principal and interest charges to cover escrow even though my escrow was being managed under the XXXX program. These changes made my monthly payments unaffordable and caused my account to appear past due even though I was making my payments through the bankruptcy court. 

Shellpoint/NewRezs actions have made it extremely hard for me to keep my home. Their accounting practices do not match my court-approved XXXX XXXX plan, and their statements are inconsistent. They continue to treat me as delinquent, which has damaged my ability to maintain payment arrangements and caused me emotional and financial stress. 

I am the only person listed on the deed since XXXX, but the loan is still in both my name and another borrower, XXXX XXXX, who has not lived in the home or contributed to the mortgage since XXXX. Shellpoint continues to send joint notices and paperwork even though I am the only homeowner. 

I believe XXXXhellpoint/NewRez violated : Bankruptcy law ( Sections 362 and 524 ) by trying to collect while I was protected under XXXX XXXX, RESPA / CFPB servicing rules by misapplying escrow and principal, and CFPB Regulation X by continuing foreclosure and delinquency activity while my account was under legal review. 

I am requesting that the CFPB review Shellpoint/NewRezs conduct during and after my XXXX XXXX XXXX and that they correct my account, remove any false delinquency reporting, and confirm compliance with federal servicing laws. 

1. Bankruptcy Law Violations ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) a. Violation of Bankruptcy Code 362 and 524 Automatic Stay and Discharge Protections During your active XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), Shellpoint/NewRez demanded {$10000.00} while payments were being made through your court-appointed trustee.

That act constitutes an unauthorized collection attempt while the debt was under court control potentially a willful stay violation under 362 ( a ).

If this continued after your plan confirmation or discharge, it may also violate 524 ( a ) ( 2 ), the discharge injunction. 

b. Improper Accounting During Court-Supervised Plan They received trustee disbursements but also billed you directly, creating a dual payment stream. 
This is explicitly prohibited under federal bankruptcy servicing standards ( see In re Gravel, 6th Cir. 2021 ) and CFPB bulletin guidance for mortgage servicers handling XXXX XXXX loans.

2. RESPA / CFPB Mortgage Servicing Rule Violations a. Misapplication of Payments and Escrow Funds Shellpoint added principal and interest to cover escrow shortages in 2023 while you were still in bankruptcy.

Under 12 CFR 1024.17 ( k ) ( 5 ), a servicer can not unilaterally increase escrow or reallocate principal/interest without proper notice and an analysis based on actual escrow account data. 
Since your escrow was managed under the XXXX program, they likely breached the requirement to maintain consistent treatment during bankruptcy-protected repayment periods. 

b. Failure to Honor Cram-Down Terms Once a cram-down is approved, the creditor must adjust the loan balance and payments per the court order. 
Shellpoints statements from XXXX still show inflated principal and interest inconsistent with your modified plan. 
This is a RESPA 1024.41 ( b ) ( 1 ) violation failure to apply loss mitigation or court-approved modification terms accurately.

c. Dual Tracking / False Delinquency Reporting While you were under active review and bankruptcy protection, Shellpoint continued to list you as delinquent and threatened foreclosure, as seen in the Delinquency Notice boxes on multiple statements. 
That violates RESPA 1024.41 ( g ) and CFPB Regulation X prohibiting foreclosure activity while a modification or legal protection is in effect.

09/05/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","In XX/XX/XXXX NewRez ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) improperly paid the first installment of my XXXX property taxes without my authorization. The tax bill was due XX/XX/XXXX, but on XX/XX/XXXX NewRez/XXXX paid it 10 days early, leaving me no chance to pay it myself as I was obligated to do under my closing documents. At closing my property taxes were not escrowed. I was responsible for paying taxes directly, with the seller reimbursing me.

When I discovered this, I called NewRez immediately and told them they had made a mistake and must not pay it. I explained my mortgage does not include escrowed property taxes. They told me I was wrong, insisted it was correct, and refused to stop payment. I told them that if they went ahead, I would not reimburse them because this was not in my contract. They said it didnt matter, but would look into it. I also told them I was working with my titling company and the seller to handle the tax reimbursement, which was the proper contractual arrangement, but they did not care. They told me they would start research but while that was supposedly pending they still disbursed the funds. I made it absolutely clear that this was an error, and that if they paid it before I could, then I would not pay them back, as I am not contractually obligated to.

I called weekly after that. At first, an employee admitted it was an error on their end ( they reviewed my mortgage documents and it clearly shows that property taxes are NOT in escrow ) but said since they had already paid, I was required to pay them back. I disagreed. They then shifted their story, saying they paid because the tax was delinquent. That was false, because they paid 10 days early, before I could even pay it. They repeatedly asked if I had attempted to pay it. I explained that was impossible once they had already paid it. They told me to wait 28 days for further review.

About two weeks later, I received an escrow analysis letter in the mail. It said my monthly payment would rise from about {$560.00} to about {$980.00}, effective in two months, because of the property-tax disbursement. The analysis even admitted that they had not expected to pay taxes, but did so anyway, which created the increase. I called and was told to be patient because the research would finish before the new payment took effect. This stressed me out immensely, but I did as I was told by NewRez.

When the research was complete, instead of a correction, I got a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. In it, NewRez claimed the tax lines are correct and stated XXXX would pay the second installment of XXXX property taxes of {$4100.00} within the economic loss date. They also said they had asked the county treasurer if a refund was possible and asked me to forward them any information I had about a refund. This was contradictory, as, if everything was correct, why would they be seeking a refund from the county treasurer? The letter completely ignored my repeated demands to remove the unauthorized escrow line, restore my escrow account for flood insurance ( about {$1000.00} ), and return my monthly payment to the correct amount. The only comment they made is an acknowledgement that I 'believe ' those things to be true, with no further statements of actions on their part.

I then contacted my titling company, who confirmed in writing that property taxes were never escrowed in my loan documents. They provided me documentation that proved NewRez had no authority to establish a tax escrow or disburse these funds. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a certified Notice of Error and Request for Information under RESPA to NewRezs designated address. It was delivered and signed for on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. That letter demanded that NewRez stop disbursing taxes, remove the tax escrow line, restore escrow for flood insurance, return my monthly payment to the proper ~ {$560.00}, and provide me full escrow records, XXXX  instructions, internal servicing notes, and call recordings. ( Those call recordings include a call where multiple NewRez customer representatives fully admit that this was clearly the companies fault, not mine, and that they just don't know how to resolve it as their system will not allow them to remove the escrow line without it being paid off, but obviously I never agreed for them to pay it or make debt in my name, so I can't pay it, so they were in a stand-still trying to figure out how to fix this. In the end of that conversation, they scheduled even more research, which is what lead to the XX/XX/XXXX letter. ) Despite being legally required to acknowledge my letter within 5 business days ( by XX/XX/XXXX ), NewRez has not sent me any acknowledgement or response as of XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my escrow account still shows a false balance of {$2800.00}, when it should be about + {$1000.00}, and my account still shows a monthly payment due of ~ {$980.00} instead of the correct ~ {$560.00}. 

I was forced to pay the second installment of XXXX property taxes myself on XX/XX/XXXX, the exact due date, because NewRez never did so despite claiming they would. This proves again that their XX/XX/XXXX letter was false. Their mismanagement has left my account in an artificial deficit, caused an unjustified increase in my monthly payment, and exposed me to risk of being marked delinquent when I have always been willing and able to pay my correct contractual payment. Also, despite continually contacting them and requesting this to be fixed, I have been constantly redirected and nothing has actually been done. My stress has been immense, and I don't know what else to do. I've tried everything I can, and I have legal counsel, but I would prefer to go this route if possible. I just want for things to be made right, and for NewRez to follow the contract they are legally obligated to follow, as I am as well. 

I am including into this submission the entire contents of the certified letter that I sent to NewRez, including my current account dashboard showing the negative escrow balance, and the fact that I have continually paid my contracted bills.

01/02/26,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue while managing or servicing your loan,"I am filing a complaint regarding a loan servicing error involving improper fees and the servicers refusal to accept principal-only payments, which has resulted in unnecessary and inaccurate interest charges. 

For the life of this loan, I have consistently paid my required monthly payment through the servicers website. The interest amount paid has always been the exact amount generated by their system ; I have no ability to alter that figure. With every payment, I have also made additional principal-only payments in order to pay down the balance faster. 

Recently, the servicer blocked my ability to make additional principal payments, stating that there are outstanding fees. After contacting the company via online chat ( XX/XX/XXXX ), submitting an online inquire ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and by calling the XXXX number ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received inconsistent explanations. A live representative ultimately stated that the company conducted an internal audit and assessed {$18.00} in fees for alleged underpayment. During that call, I authorized payment of the fee under protest, yet the servicer has still failed to resolve the issue or restore my ability to make principal-only payments. 
I dispute the validity of this fee for the following reasons : XXXX. I paid exactly the interest amount required by the servicers system. 
XXXX. There is no option on the servicers website to pay this alleged fee. 
XXXX. The fee is not added to my regular monthly payment or otherwise itemized in a way that allows payment. 

Despite this, the servicer is refusing to accept principal-only payments. As a result, they are continuing to charge interest on principal that I attempted to pay down but was prevented from paying due to the servicers actions. 

This is causing financial harm through unnecessary interest accrual and appears to be an unfair servicing practice. If the fee were legitimate, the servicer should provide clear notice, contractual justification, and a reasonable method of payment.

No buyer eligibility review or underwriting was conducted, and no specific XXXX XXXXegulation, investor guideline, or loan-specific restriction was cited to support this determination.

CFPA / UDAAP The combined conductfalse filings, harassment, and disregard of borrower communicationsconstitutes unfair, deceptive, and abusive behavior in connection with mortgage servicing, directly regulated by the CFPB. Due to the foregoing standing deficiencies, nondisclosures, and multiple statutory and federal law violations I mailed my first notice of intent to sue on XX/XX/year>. Thereafter, additional pre-suit notices and demands for remedy were sent on XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; XX/XX/year> ; and XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XXXX. Despite these multiple good-faith attempts to resolve the matter without litigation, XXXX failed to respond adequately. These actions caused emotional distress, loss of quiet enjoyment, reputational harm, and a clouded title to my home. I have brought a counterclaim in court seeking quiet title and damages, but I submit this complaint to request CFPB oversight and investigation into XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for systemic consumer-finance violations. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, primarily a life insurance entity, has entered the mortgage business for investment purposes through its affiliate, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, XXXX foreclosure filings show procedural irregularities and defective documentation inconsistent with prudent institutional and fiduciary standards expected of a regulated financial entity. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, acting as plaintiff in our foreclosure, has not demonstrated lawful possession or standing to enforce the note, and the documentation relied uponincluding conflicting allonges and a late-recorded assignmentfails to establish a valid chain of title. This conduct raises significant consumer protection and transparency issues under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), and the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), which prohibit deceptive and unfair servicing and foreclosure practices. I respectfully request the CFPBs investigation into the use of insurance affiliates such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in mortgage acquisition and enforcement, particularly when such entities are not primary lenders or servicers and operate without adequate consumer disclosures or verification of legal standing. Public reviews and consumer accounts about XXXX XXXX XXXX and investment operations reveal a troubling pattern of deceptive and misleading practices, including allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and failure to honor obligations. These complaints mirror the same lack of transparency and accountability observed in XXXX mortgage operations. This suggests broader corporate deficiencies in consumer protection compliance. I respectfully request that the CFPB evaluate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX overall adherence to federal consumer protection standards across all product lines, including its mortgage holdings and foreclosure practices.

12/19/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","My mortgage servicer, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, mishandled my homeowners insurance, escrow account, and payment history, resulting in improper charges, inflated payment demands, and the initiation of pre-foreclosure activity despite my maintaining insurance and making payments. 

For many years, my homeowners insurance was paid directly by me ( not through escrow ), and Shellpoints own escrow analysis in XX/XX/XXXX reflected this correctly. 

Insurance and force-placed insurance errors : XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint sent XXXX requesting proof of insurance renewal, even though my policy was active and premiums were being paid through automatic payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint stated my insurance had expired, which was incorrect. The policy had renews in XXXX, and coverage was continuous. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint escalated to final and unable to confirm insurance notices, even though there was no lapse in coverage. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint placed force-placed insurance on the account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint paid approximately {$7000.00} to my actual insurance XXXX, confirming coverage existed and was active. 

Despite this confirmation, Shellpoint did not cancel the force-placed insurance to my knowledge as I have not been informed otherwise. 

Misapplication of funds : After the insurer refunded the {$7000.00} to Shellpoint because my account was current as well as I was listed as the responsible party, Shellpoint misapplied the funds by posting them to future monthly payments and principal instead of correcting the escrow error. 

These misapplications were only corrected after I contacted Shellpoint in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Escrow and payment issues : Shellpoint later added homeowners insurance into escrow without proper notice, creating an artificial escrow shortage and increasing my monthly payment. 

My regular monthly payment prior to these errors was approximately {$610.00}, but XXXX system began showing conflicting and significantly higher amounts. The payments are now {$1300.00} with a new amount issued as I am writing this complaint. 

Fees such as late fees and NSF fees were assessed even though payments were made and, in some cases, cleared the following day. 

Borrower record and bankruptcy errors : Shellpoint repeatedly referenced a former co-borrower who signed a quit claim deed years ago and is not involved in servicing. 

Shellpoint also implied that bankruptcy applied to the loan, which is incorrect. I have never filed bankruptcy, and the mortgage has never included in any bankruptcy proceeding. 

Pre-foreclosure action : On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint issued a pre-foreclosure notice even though any alleged delinquency was caused by its own unresolved servicing errors and disputed charges. 

Impact : These errors caused financial hardship, emotional distress, and fear of losing my home. I repeatedly contacted Shellpoint to correct the issues, but the problems persisted, and corrective action was delayed or refused unless I pursued options like refinancing or loan assumption, which did not address the underlying errors. 

I am asking for CFPB assistance to ensure the servicer corrects the insurance and escrow errors, fixes the payment history, removes improper fees and delinquency coding, stops foreclosure activity, and accurately reflects that no bankruptcy applies to this loan.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",WA,99207,None,Consent provided,Web,12/19/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,18161493

First it was the change in how they handled interest. Which I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX when it recast the loan was supposed to be a fix XXXX XXXX year rate. 

Now, Shellpoint Mortgage has decided to create an escrow, which we have never had. 
They apparently did this because when we changed insurance carriers, they didnt like the way the new insurance policy had the ownership defined. Even though we send documents showing them that there was insurance on the property, because they didnt like the insured names, they put a second policy on the property and then setup an escrow account so they could charge us for the second policy. 

After several calls and multiple copies of the insurance policy they finally accepted the insurance documents. 

They supposedly refunded the charges for the second policy and refunded the balance of the escrow, which I havent seen. 

Here is where the real issue comes in. They kept the escrow account and are now charging us an escrow amount, demanding a payment into an escrow that shouldnt even exist. 

How or why I cant get them to give me answer for. Especially since we have, since the beginning of the loan, always paid the property taxes and the insurance and still do. 
I have requested them to close the escrow and refund our money but they have denied it. 

I send Shellpoint Mortgage requested a Qualified Written Request on XX/XX/year> and as of right now, XX/XX/year>, have only received a letter that they need more time. 

Prior to the insurance issue there was no escrow. After many conversations they refunded the second insurance policy charges and XXXX refund checks taking the escrow account to zero. XXXX check that I havent received yet. 

Then, after correcting everything, they decided to increase the escrow charge and have been charging me for an escrow that was supposed to be closed. Especially, since they dont pay any of the bills. They are just tying up my money making it harder for me to actually pay my bills and creating a financial hardship for me",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MI,48430,None,Consent provided,Web,09/23/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16132909

11/19/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"CFPB COMPLAINT EXPANDED XXXX  WITH XXXXXXXXXXXX  EXTORTION ARGUMENT Product : Mortgage Sub-product : VA Mortgage Company : NewRez LLC XXXX Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TN 1. SUMMARY OF THE ISSUE NewRez/Shellpoint called me from their Compliance Department today .

The representative refused to answer any question regarding : my missing XXXX payment unapplied funds conflicting ledger entries contradictory balances solely because I was recording the call which is fully legal under Tennessees one-party consent statute. 

This refusal is evidence of : concealment obstruction platform corruption inability to explain their own system fear of creating discoverable statements servicing misconduct 2. FEDERAL LAW VIOLATIONS ( RESPA, TILA, FDCPA, UDAAP, VA SERVICING ) All original citations remain applicable and included : RESPA 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) RESPA 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 TILA 15 U.S.C. 1639f FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692e and 1692f UDAAP 12 U.S.C. 5531 ( a ) VA servicing regulations under 38 C.F.R. 36.4350 CFPB XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) CFPB XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) CFPB XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX oversight standards 3. XXXX XXXX ( THE CORE STRUCTURAL FAILURE ) In multiple CFPB filings, NewRez/Shellpoint have stated : We have nothing to do with XXXX. 
We are not affiliated with XXXX. 
XXXX is not our parent. 
We have no relationship with XXXX. 

These are federal-record statements. 
They carry legal consequences. 

XXXX XXXX is the publicly disclosed owner of NewRez and Shellpoint. 

If NewRez denies any affiliation with XXXX, then under federal regulatory classifications : NewRez is operating as an XXXX  entity. 

And an XXXX  entity : can not service loans can not legally enforce mortgages can not collect payments can not claim authority over VA loans can not maintain standing can not issue balances can not initiate or threaten foreclosure can not report to credit bureaus can not determine escrow can not contact consumers for payment This legally voids the loans enforceability. 



* * 4. NEW SECTION ( YOUR REQUEST ) : WHY IS NEWREZ CONTACTING ME ABOUT A LOAN THEY HAVE NO LEGAL AUTHORITY TO TOUCH? * * This is the new nuclear logic : If NewRez states on a federal record that they have nothing to do with XXXX and XXXX is the disclosed owner of NewRez, then NewRez has no lawful parent, no lawful authority, no lawful servicing rights, and no lawful right to contact me at all. 

Therefore, when NewRez calls me : to demand money to discuss payments to demand verification to refuse to explain missing funds to threaten delinquency to maintain an account balance to classify me as behind to contact me for anything They are : operating without authority attempting to collect without ownership attempting to enforce a void loan acting as an unlicensed XXXX  XXXX  engaging in unlawful collection activity exerting financial pressure without standing extorting payments under false authority This constitutes : FDCPA 1692e false representation of authority FDCPA 1692f unfair/unauthorized collection activity UDAAP abusive and deceptive practice RESPA failure to provide ownership evidence VA Servicing Violations unauthorized contact with VA borrower This is extortion under the definition of : demanding payment without legal right or authority. 

By contacting me about a loan they admit they do not legally service or own, NewRez is : misrepresenting their capacity exerting pressure on a VA borrower attempting to collect payments they are not entitled to concealing the absence of standing engaging in deceptive servicing If NewRez is not owned by XXXX, NewRez can not enforce my mortgage. 
If NewRez can not enforce my mortgage, every contact they make is unauthorized. 
If every contact is unauthorized, the attempt to collect is extortion. 

This is the unavoidable logic of their own statements on federal record. 



5. SYSTEMIC HARM AND VA BORROWER IMPACT NewRezs denials have now created a national-risk scenario : every VA borrower they service is now exposed every TN borrower is exposed every loan under their platform is legally suspect every contradictory ledger becomes evidence of platform corruption every wrong company response is confirmation of system collapse This is not consumer error. 
This is servicer-originated systemic failure.

Details of Violations and Pattern of Non-Compliance : Identical Responses to Distinct Complaints : Shellpoint 's boilerplate replies lump all issues together without addressing specifics, such as my requests for chain of title, servicing notes, or recorded calls ( e.g., with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX.

On XX/XX/year>, I attempted to log into the NewRez website to create my payment schedule. However, upon logging in, I received an error message stating : "" The loan is in active bankruptcy. Please contact the bankruptcy department to service this loan. '' As a result, I was unable to access my account or make my regular mortgage payment. Furthermore, my ability to view and confirm my escrow account details, including the home insurance fee due by XX/XX/year>, was also blocked. 

I want to emphasize that neither my spouse nor I have ever missed a mortgage payment or filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, our XXXX XXXX is XXXX, reflecting our commitment to maintaining financial responsibility. Despite these facts, NewRez Mortgage 's website and app are showing incorrect information regarding my loan status, leading to significant confusion and frustration.

XX/XX/year> I submitted a request through the NewRez app explaining the situation and requesting that the error be fixed.

09/23/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I have tried working with Shellpoint Mortgage Customer Service for about XXXX months to find a resolution to an error their company created. My account is a non-escrow account, and has held that status long before it was acquired by Newrez ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) in XX/XX/XXXX XXXX.. Since that time, the monthly payment has consistently been {$1700.00}, which includes both principal and interest payments. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I made arrangements with my insurant agent from XXXX XXXX XXXX, for Slide Insurance to cover my XXXX XXXX requirements. We established a quarterly payment option where the first installment of {$2700.00} was processed in XXXX, XXXX A.D., with XXXX remaining payments of {$1300.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint Mortgage paid the entire insurance premium, and XXXX XXXX sent me a refund check for the amount of my initial payment. 

As mentioned, I have tried to resolve this issue with XXXX Mortgage Customer Service Representatives for months. My initial approach was to coordinate a call with my insurance agent from XXXX XXXX XXXX to confirm that I had the proper insurance coverage and that my payments were up to date. Unfortunately, although our meeting should have proved my case, the Customer Service Team was unable to resolve the issue regarding the forced escrow payment. 

My next approach was to resolve the issue through a representative from their Insurance Department. I was put in contact with XXXX XXXX. 
When I first spoke wth XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX A.D., she provided her contact information as : Phone number : XXXX Email address : XXXX In our conversation, I explained the situation as I have documented in this letter, and after not hearing back, I followed up the following week through a series of emails : ( a copy of the following emails is enclosed ) Date : Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX A.D. at XXXXXXXX XXXX Subject : What is the progress since last weeks conversation? 
In the letter, I forwarded an email from Shellpoint, showing how I was still receiving communications that I was not paying my mortgage. As a result, I was reported to the credit bureaus, which significantly impacted my credit score.

I once faced a similar situation with a previous mortgage company, and was able to resolve it with a representative from the corporate management team. Trying to resolve this situation by speaking with different representatives each time I call, having to explain the entire situation again, and working with people who can not address the issue is futile. For this reason, I have submitted this written request and ask for the name, email, and phone number of a manager with whom I can discuss and resolve this situation. 

I told Shellpoint Mortgage that I have complete confidence that this matter can be resolved. This occurred due to a misunderstanding of the original arrangement. I understand that Shellpoint Mortgage must have millions of clients, and I am simply a drop in the bucket, but we are talking about my home mortgage. In the same way that one reading my request, values their primary home mortgage as an essential issue for them, I know they can empathize with my situation. 

We all have shared life experiences, and any human can appreciate the time it has taken me to resolve this issue and write this letter to resolve this matter, which should never have occurred in the first place.

On XX/XX/year>, I received a letter from Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing dated XX/XX/year>, stating that my complete loan modification application is under review and that no foreclosure activity will proceed during this evaluation. However, my assigned SPOC has provided contradictory verbal information, stating a different status for the review, which directly conflicts with the written letter. This inconsistency is creating extreme confusion, especially as I am a XXXX XXXX  homeowner facing an imminent foreclosure sale on XX/XX/year>. 
Additionally, the 9-day delay between the letter 's date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and its receipt ( XX/XX/XXXX ) appears to be an unfair practice that deprived me of timely notice and the opportunity to respond effectively. As a result, I am uncertain about the true status of my application and whether foreclosure activities are truly paused. 
These actions violate federal mortgage servicing rules under Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.40 ), which requires servicers to assign a SPOC who provides accurate, consistent, and clear information about loss mitigation options. The conflicting statements between the letter and SPOC communications breach this requirement. Furthermore, the backdated and delayed notice may constitute unfair or deceptive acts under the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ), as it misleads consumers about the timeline of their review process. 
If foreclosure advances while my application is supposedly under review, this would also violate dual-tracking prohibitions under Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ). As a XXXX XXXX in California, these practices are causing severe emotional distress and putting my primary residence at risk.

09/13/25,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","I am filing a complaint regarding my mortgage loan servicing with NewRez ( also known as Shellpoint/XXXX  ). My mortgage account has been mishandled multiple times, resulting in repeated errors, escrow mismanagement, and improper payment increases. 
Most recently, I discovered that my home owners insurance had not been paid for which resulted in no coverage for a year, even though escrow funds were collected for that purpose and I received email confirmation saying the payment was made. The company tried to give me insurance and I had to call to set back up my previous home insurance plan. This was the servicers error, not mine. 

In addition to the insurance issue, there have been repeated problems with how my property taxes are handled. My escrow payment due keeps raising which the lack of payment in insurance should have kept it down. The servicer has made errors in the amounts collected and paid out of escrow, which has contributed to ongoing miscalculations. Because of these combined mistakes, my monthly mortgage payment has been repeatedly increased, most recently by more than {$100.00} per month. These increases are not the result of my actions but of the servicers failure to manage escrow properly. 
I have requested explanations from the servicer, but I have not received a clear or accurate escrow analysis that justifies these increases. I believe my escrow account has been mishandled in violation of RESPA. This situation has caused me financial hardship and stress, as I am being charged higher payments due to the servicers own errors. Additionally, the company keeps sending me a XXXX check. I have already cashed the check but received it several other times and received a call from the company notifying me they are going to send it out again and I need to cash it. 

My escrow going up XXXX times for taxes when my state does tax analysis once yearly ( my taxes went down ), the repetitious sending of the same check, the year without homeowners insurance, and the most recent payment increase lead me to believe my loan is completely mishandled. 

I am requesting a full and accurate escrow history and analysis for the past XXXX years, a correction of any errors in my escrow account, removal of any payment increases that resulted from the servicers mistakes in failing to pay my insurance and mishandling my property tax payments, and written confirmation that this will be handled properly from the company going forward.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TX,79423,None,Consent provided,Web,09/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15918700
09/06/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance",Im XXXX XXXX  XXXX and therefore am tax exempt in XXXX XXXX where I live! In XXXX I went to the controller and filed to have my taxes deferred and to get my homestead exemption which I got. I then filed the paperwork with Caliber mortgage the lender at that time which then became NewRez which is who they are now! They said that they would file the paperwork and that I could call back in one week and that I would then be in their system and would be tax exempt and would not be charged taxes. I called back after one week and they stated I was setup in their system and was not going to be charged taxes. Later that year I was indeed charged taxes anyway. When I found out I was charged taxes I called them and asked what was going on. They said I was not setup as tax exempt. I said I called in and setup myself up and was in their system. They looked it up and figured it out that I was setup and then said that I was setup and that they would return the money to the county in 5 days. They took 4 months to return the money all the time charging me {$3700.00}!! After they returned the money they then did and analysis on the house and decided that they would raise my mortgage to a higher amount since my house was worth more money now!! The next year came around and they said to call in and let them know that I was tax exempt and they would not charge me taxes. So I called them early in the year but they charged me taxes anyway!! They then said they would return the money but took 3 months to return the money the whole time charging me over {$3000.00} a month!! After they returned the money they then did another analysis on my house and raised the mortgage again! This started to become a pattern! Every year they would charge me taxes when they were not supposed to while claiming that I was not tax exempt even though I am in their system as tax exempt!! I keep calling them every year early to tell them not to charge me taxes yet they do it anyways. Then when they say that they are going to send the money back to XXXX XXXX they take 4 months to send the money back!! After they send the money back they do an analysis on my house and raise my mortgage. They are driving me out of my house by raising the mortgage!!! This is not right!!! They claim that the county is sending them a bill but I had the county remove them from my account so there is no way they can get a bill from the county unless they ask for a bill from the county!! They keep saying the county is sending them a bill though which is a lie!!! I have verified this with the comptroller of the county!!! As of XX/XX/XXXX they still have money that they have to return from this year that they took from me as taxes which they were not supposed to have charged me which they were supposed to return 4 months ago!!!!

01/06/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,Foreclosure,"To Whom It May Concern, I am submitting this complaint regarding Shellpoint Mortgage Servicings refusal or failure to postpone a scheduled foreclosure sale, despite clear evidence that the property securing the loan is actively listed for sale and will result in a full payoff of the mortgage debt. 
Loan Number : XXXX Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Scheduled Sale Date : XX/XX/year> The property is currently actively listed on the CRMLS at a competitive market price and was recently reduced to encourage an expedited sale. Based on current market conditions and buyer activity, a successful sale and full payoff are reasonably imminent. Documentation supporting the active listing and price reduction has been provided to the servicer. 
Proceeding with a foreclosure sale under these circumstances is unnecessary, avoidable, and harmful, particularly when the servicer is positioned to be paid in full through an arms-length market transaction. Allowing the sale to proceed would create irreparable harm to the borrower while providing no financial benefit to the investor beyond what is already assured. 
I am the listing real estate broker and authorized third party, and I have formally requested that Shellpoint postpone the sale date to allow sufficient time for the transaction to close escrow. This request is reasonable, time-limited, and aligned with loss-mitigation principles and the CFPBs servicing standards, including the obligation to avoid unnecessary foreclosure where alternatives exist. 
Shellpoints failure to pause the sale under these conditions raises serious concerns regarding : Failure to exercise reasonable loss-mitigation discretion Unnecessary advancement of foreclosure despite a pending full payoff Potential unfair servicing practices causing avoidable consumer harm This complaint seeks CFPB intervention XXXX require Shellpoint to postpone the XX/XX/year> foreclosure sale and allow the open-market transaction to proceed to closing, resulting in full satisfaction of the mortgage debt.

11/15/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"CFPB COMPLAINT SYSTEMIC SERVICING FAILURE, DATA CORRUPTION, WRONGFUL FORECLOSURE RISK, AND MULTI-BORROWER HARM Consumer : XXXX XXXX Servicer : NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing Parent Company : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Product : VA Mortgage Issue : Systemic misapplication of payments, data corruption, false delinquency, contradictory federal representations, imminent harm to borrowers I. Summary of Complaint I am filing this complaint to report system-wide data corruption, misapplied funds, false delinquency reporting, contradictory corporate representations, and imminent harm to consumers, including myself as a XXXX veteran with a VA-backed loan . 

My account has been corrupted since XXXX. 
Payments disappear, reappear, shift between months, or get placed into suspense. 
I have received another borrowers foreclosure letter, and I am now receiving correspondence from a Florida address that does not match Shellpoints declared headquarters, consistent with multi-system contamination. 

At the same time, the parent company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is telling the CFPB that complaints naming XXXX are directed to the wrong company, while filing SEC disclosures that state the exact opposite : that XXXX owns, consolidates, controls, and profits from NewRez/Shellpoint .

These contradictions create a high-risk, multi-borrower crisis requiring urgent CFPB action.

II. Findings 1. My loan servicing data is corrupted Payments are not credited when received. 
Unapplied funds have accumulated for years. 
Conflicting ledgers produce different balances depending on the portal or department. 
Escrow values change without explanation. 
A {$3900.00} payment was moved to XX/XX/XXXX, then removed from the ledger entirely. 
Funds placed in suspense contradict the servicers own call recordings. 

2. I received a foreclosure notice belonging to another borrower This is not a clerical error.

This proves that borrower data and foreclosure processing streams are contaminated.

3. My mail is now being routed through XXXX XXXX, Florida a location that does not match Shellpoints declared headquarters Shellpoints operations are based in South Carolina.

NewRezs operations are in Pennsylvania. 
Yet I received official correspondence from : Shellpoint XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX This is consistent with : legacy routing tables, corrupted system identifiers, and cross-database contamination. 

This is a hallmark indicator of platform-wide data instability. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is denying ownership of NewRez to regulators while affirming ownership to the SEC In at least XXXX CFPB responses, XXXX stated the complaint does not belong to us. 
But in its SEC filings ( Form XXXX, Form XXXX, Form XXXX, Form XXXX, and insider transactions ), XXXX : consolidates NewRez revenue and assets, describes NewRez as a wholly-owned subsidiary, grants executive compensation based on servicing-platform earnings, and states it ultimately owns a number of subsidiaries, including the entities involved in my servicing. 

These contradictory statements create what I call the Orphan Company Paradox : XXXX is enriched by NewRezs servicing income while disowning NewRez to avoid regulatory accountability for servicing failures. 



III. Evidence A. Ledger corruption and payment manipulation Multiple ledgers showing different balances.

Suspense funds acknowledged on recorded calls.

The servicer claims error, but errors of this magnitude indicate systemic failure. 

XXXX XXXX foreclosure letter I received foreclosure documents for an entirely different consumer. 
This demonstrates : cross-borrower contamination, privacy breaches, wrongful foreclosure risk. 

C. Contradictory addresses ( SC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX print routing ) This indicates a fragmented and corrupted data environment. 

D. Public borrower reports showing the same failures I submitted XXXX screenshots documenting years of identical harm to other consumers, including reports that parents and seniors are experiencing the same failures. 

E. SEC contradictions XXXX executives sell stock based on subsidiary earnings ( Forms XXXX and XXXX ). 
XXXX asserts ownership in every securities filing. 
Yet XXXX denies association to the CFPB. 

This is a cross-jurisdiction contradiction with consumer harm implications. 



IV. Legal Interpretation XXXX. RESPA Regulation X Violations ( XXXX C.F.R. XXXX, XXXX ) Failure to correct errors. 
Failure to apply payments when received. 
Failure to respond properly to Notices of Error.

Failure to investigate borrower disputes.

Sending another borrowers foreclosure documents.

2. TILA / Regulation Z Violations ( 12 C.F.R. 1026.36 ( c ) ( 1 ) ) Misapplication of payments and inaccurate statements constitute direct violations.

3. UDAP / UDAAP Violations ( 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536 ) It is deceptive to : consolidate and profit from servicing operations in SEC filings, while denying ownership and responsibility in the CFPB portal to avoid accountability for servicing abuses.

4. Federal foreclosure-process violations Wrong-borrower foreclosure notices implicate wrongful-foreclosure doctrines across all jurisdictions. 

XXXX. VA XXXX Protections As a XXXX veteran, mishandling of a VA loan constitutes heightened federal concern, particularly when : data is corrupted, payments vanish, foreclosure risk is created. 

XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX has : XXXX knowledge of its ownership of NewRez, CFPB-facing denials of that ownership, and an operational platform inflicting widespread consumer harm.

This is a classic breach of oversight duty under Delaware law.

V. Risk Impact Imminent, escalating, multi-borrower harm. 
The system is : corrupting ledgers, misrouting data, mixing borrower files, generating false foreclosure risk, violating federal mortgage-servicing law, and endangering veterans, seniors, and families. 

This is no longer a dispute. 
It is a platform failure with national risk. 



VI. Requested CFPB Action 1. Immediate supervisory investigation of NewRez LLC and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, including full data-governance review.

2. Referral to the SEC for cross-jurisdiction contradictions involving XXXX ownership claims in securities filings vs wrong company claims in CFPB responses. 
3. Order a forensic audit of my loan, including : full reconstruction of my ledger, correction of unapplied funds, reversal of false delinquency reports, verification of escrow accounting.

4. Immediate stop of any foreclosure activity due to platform instability.

5. Mandate a system-wide audit across all borrowers due to multi-year, multi-consumer evidence of identical harm.

6. Order monetary relief for damages sustained and escalating daily due to continued non-correction : {>= $1,000,000} in damages, and payoff of my mortgage, consistent with federal consumer-protection statutes, RESPA remedies, UDAAP penalties, data-governance failures, and case law involving systemic servicing misconduct.

VII. Harm to Other Borrowers ( Systemic and Widespread ) The servicing failures documented in my account are not isolated.

I have reviewed hundreds of public borrower reports, including historical data going back to XXXX, and the same patterns appear repeatedly across consumers in multiple states : Misapplied payments Suspense account dumping Conflicting ledgers False delinquency Manufactured foreclosure risk Missing payments Escrow miscalculations Inability to obtain accurate account histories Borrowers receiving one anothers documents Veterans and seniors being placed into delinquency despite making full payments These borrowers include : Elderly individuals on fixed incomes, XXXX veterans like myself, Families with children at risk of wrongful foreclosure, Parents reporting the same errors I am experiencing, Borrowers whose accounts show unexplained increases, Borrowers whose ledgers do not match their statements or portals, Borrowers who have lost homes or nearly lost them due to misapplied funds. 

I submitted screenshots demonstrating these patterns spanning multiple years and multiple servicing platforms within NewRez/Shellpoint. These are not customer-service lapses. They represent a structural failure of the underlying data environment, affecting thousands of consumers. 

Because the same errors repeat across states, loan types, and consumer profiles, this constitutes : System-wide risk to every borrower serviced by NewRez and Shellpoint. 

These patterns are identical to those observed in past federal enforcement actions against large servicers for : systemic misapplication of funds, incorrect delinquency reporting, wrongful foreclosure practices, and UDAAP violations under 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536.

This is not an individual mistake. It is a replicated servicing defect affecting consumers nationally. 

As a XXXX veteran, my own risk is severe. But the harm is not limited to me. 
Borrowers across the country are being placed in danger through : corrupted records, inaccurate balances, loss of payment history integrity, and cross-account contamination that results in people receiving other borrowers documents, including foreclosure notices. 

This creates foreseeable and imminent harm that rises to the level of systemic consumer-risk under CFPB supervisory standards.

VIII. Requested Action for All Affected Borrowers Along with the corrective and monetary relief for my own loan, I request the CFPB initiate a platform-wide enforcement action requiring : 1. Full-servicer forensic audit A top-to-bottom examination of : payment application logic, suspense-account methodology, ledger integrity, servicing data governance, foreclosure processing, cross-borrower data contamination, and all system interfaces used by NewRez and Shellpoint. 

2. Mandatory remediation for every borrower Including : correction of misapplied funds, reconstruction of corrupted ledgers, reimbursement of wrongfully assessed fees, reversal of manufactured delinquencies, and full review of foreclosure activity to identify cases triggered by corrupted or inaccurate data.

3. Protection for veterans, seniors, and vulnerable borrowers Many veterans report suffering from identical errors involving unapplied payments and escalation to foreclosure. 
Given my own XXXX loan, I request the CFPB prioritize an immediate review of : all VA loan XXXX handled by NewRez/Shellpoint, all delinquency coding involving VA borrowers, and any foreclosure activity involving VA loans since XXXX XXXX 

4. Federal coordination with the SEC, FTC, VA, and state regulators Because the servicing failures overlap with : SEC-reporting contradictions ( Rithms ownership vs wrong company claims ), data-governance breakdowns, cross-account contamination, and multi-borrower harm across state lines, I request interagency coordination consistent with Dodd-Frank 112 and supervisory protocols for systemic consumer-finance risk.

5. Enforcement orders preventing continued use of the wrong company defense Because these contradictions contribute directly to delayed remediation and consumer harm, the CFPB should require XXXX/NewRez/Shellpoint to cease using false corporate disassociation statements.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/15/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,17275584

08/25/25,Debt or credit management,Mortgage modification or foreclosure avoidance,Charged upfront or unexpected fees,None,"Its important to note that an, official Court Ordered Modification Settlement was signed and approved by all parties and attorneys back on XX/XX/XXXX. This left a bad taste in the banks mouth after two bites at the apple and a 13 year long foreclosure court battle ( XXXX & XXXX ) ; with them having trouble showing full legal standing to properly foreclose, which would have left a clouded title in place. So, the settlement was the only way to resolve in the courts eyes other than a courts ruling in my favor. 

After 14 months with XXXX XXXX, the mortgage loan was transfer to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing on or about XX/XX/XXXX. Due to late transfer notices to me, and Mortgage Statement from XXXX  showing a XX/XX/XXXX payment was due, I was confused and in fear of fraud, so I continued to make my payments to XXXX  until XX/XX/XXXX ; my first payment to Shellpoint was on XX/XX/XXXX. 

It seemed because of this Shellpoint, prematurely decided to start a foreclosure case, and hired, and assigned this matter to a Foreclosure Attorney. I was shocked, when I saw the XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement showing with later letters from them stating the starting of a Foreclosure actions, after 4 letters of complaint from me to Shellpoint ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ) asking for their legal justification of the {$490.00} Attorney & Foreclosure charge. In my XX/XX/XXXX letter I clearly showed via my undisputed bank statements ( ACH payments ) my payments to both XXXX  and Shellpoint from XXXX to XXXX along with my intent to continue paying to XXXX. 

Only after 4 acknowledgment letters from Shellpoint, asking for more time ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ) did I get a formal 53-page Shellpoint response dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX replying saying & showing nothing more than back dated letters, which some I never received, stating they found no errors in their presentation and stand by their position. Shellpoint never attempted, to shown that I, the borrower, did anything to justify legal action from the lender? 

While Shellpoint also stating that XXXX assessed the attorneys fees on XX/XX/XXXX. Please remember according to Shellpoint and XXXX, that XXXX was no longer the servicer as of the end of XX/XX/XXXX. So how could XXXX assist this so late in the game? I now simply ask, who assigned this fee and to clearly justify this premature Foreclosure Action. I have shown my un-missed ACH mortgage payments history, with payment clearing dates exiting my account. 

Also note that on XXXX, Shellpoint attempted to self-assign property insurance, claiming the property did not have insurance. Shellpoint refused to contact XXXX to have these and others documents properly foreword to them. This servicer transfer was not transparent to me. Shellpoints self-assigned insurance they had placed in effect was more expensive with less coverage than my policy that has been in effect since XX/XX/XXXX. It took some time and effort from me to have the insurance declaration updated to show the new servicer and forward the update to Shellpoint, along with me stating I was not paying for their self-assign insurance. I never had to do this with other properties. 

How do Shellpoint justify 2-escrow adjustments in one 4-month period. Its clear to me mistakes were made on Shellpoint side and they want to hold be accountable for there errors. On XX/XX/XXXX, I mysteriously received an escrow surplus disbursement check for {$1800.00}. Then effective XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage payments increased by {$27.00}, on top of the {$490.00} Attorneys Fee. Why give me a surplus check, to only come back 2 weeks later and ask for more, when the {$27.00} ( {$320.00} annual ) could have been taken from the escrow surplus check 2 weeks earlier?

We have a lot of discrepancies here to be address. The main one being the {$490.00} Attorney Fees for a premature Foreclosure Action.

THE COMPANY HAD EVERYTHING THEY REQUESTED LONG BEFORE THE FORECLOSURE SALE : The HVAC had been repaired BEFORE the claim money was even sent to the crooks at Shellpoint ; however, they used this request as an excuse to delay payment until after the auction so they could say we didn't provide them with information. They are frauds. We sent them the HVAC estimate on XX/XX/XXXX ( DAY OF AUCTION ) because that was the FIRST DAY that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX '' ( XXXX XXXX ) at Shellpoint asked for it. What was he doing since the claim check arrived to them on XX/XX/year>?

I have attached an email chain consisting of XXXX emails where my insurance agency, the property manager, and I were trying to get these morons ( Shellpoint ) what they asked for at the last minute, even though it was completely irrelevant to the remaining payment.

My original complaint was Complaint # XXXX If you will read the emails following between myself and XXXX XXXX of Shellpoint, you can see that I was ultimately proven correct in that I was entitled to interest rate reduction under the CARES ACT according to XXXX XXXX guidelines . However, that is not what happened. 

The emails will show that Shellpoint engaged in a deceitful and deceptive practice by dual tracking my account, acknowledging my rights to the modification, while at the same time, 22 days later, violated federal law by electronically filing a foreclosure action against me in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The first page of the action is included, and from the header at the top left of the page you can see that it was filed on XX/XX/XXXX as File # XXXX, E-FILED, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  This is a clear violation of CFPB Regulation X, a violation under the Consumer Protection Financial Act of 2010, of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Section 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( g ) covers issues regarding what is referred to as dual tracking. Shellpoint began actively pursuing foreclosure while simultaneously assuring me that I would be accepted for loss mitigation pursuant to the CARES ACT.

( See Gresham v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 642 F. Appx 355 ( 5th Cir. 2016 ) ; see also Herrera v. Bank of Am., N.A., No. 15-CV-62156, 2016 WL 4542105, at * 8 ( S.D. Fla. Aug. 31, 2016 ). Section 1024.41 ( g ) provides the prohibition on dual tracking, 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( a ) expressly provides consumers such as myself, a right of action in the event the servicer ignores that prohibition. Gresham v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 642 F. Appx 355, 359 ( 5th Cir. 2016 ). 

My mortgage was originated through XXXX XXXX XXXX, who retained the servicing of the mortgage as the loan was sold to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX servicing was transferred to Shellpoint and that is when the violations of law began. 

SHELLPOINT SENT A CHECK BACK TO ME IN THE AMOUNT OF {$4500.00}, THAT I PREVIOUSLY PAID TO THEM PER THEIR DEMAND. 

I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CASH THIS CHECK AS BANK WOULD NOT CLEAR IT. SO I HAVE PAID SHELLPOINT, ( INCLUDING THE CHECK ABOVE ), TOTAL OF {$17000.00} SINCE FIRST TRIAL MOD STARTED ON XX/XX/XXXX, WHICH WORKS OUT TO XXXX XXXX THROUGH XXXX XXXX, 13 MONTHS, AVERAGE OF {$1300.00} A MONTH. 

COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL XXXX XXXX OF {$900.00}, TIMES 13 MONTHS = {$11000.00}. 

SO THROUGH ALL THE SHELLPOINT TRIAL MODS I PAID SHELLPOINT {$5800.00} MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL PAYMENT RATE. 

You can see by examining the documents contained herein my rights have been violated by the deceptive and manipulative practices of Shellpoint. I am therefore requesting that you investigate the facts as I have provided as to the conduct of Shellpoint. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX EMAILS FOLLOW BELOW : XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Good Afternoon, After review of the file we are going to honor the loan modification but in order to proceed with the modification. To accept it we need for you to make the payments that would have been due as of today the amount is {$4500.00} along with the full divorce decree. Thanks in advance Best Regards XXXX XXXX Loss Mitigation Specialist Hours of Operation : Monday thru Friday XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX Toll Free XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX to XXXX me Good afternoon. 

Based on the most recent trial modification package I made a payment for XXXX in the amount of {$810.00}. When I tried to make the XXXX payment I was prevented from doing so, both on line and in telephone conversations with Shellpoint employees. I was not willing to take a chance on this sudden change of terms, so I actually used my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account to issue a payment to Shellpoint in the same amount, {$810.00}, which shows it cleared my account on XX/XX/XXXX, meaning that two of the three required payments have been made pursuant to the most recent trial mod package. So, if the trial mod document is to continue governing our relationship, the only payment I would be due for would be the XXXX payment of the same amount. Did these payments get credited to my account or were they put in a suspense account? 

So, I am not sure how you came up with the amount due as {$4500.00}. Can you explain that to me? 

Keep in mind that I have been trying for over two years to get the modification corrected to follow the federal CARES ACT with no success. Regardless, I have continued to make the payments at the amounts requested by Shellpoint knowing that they are overcharged based on the incorrect interest rate, feeling confident that eventually Shellpoint will correct the modification and my "" overpayments '' will be correctly amortized and the excess could either be refunded to me or credited to the mortgage balance. 

I will gather the information you requested regarding my divorce and send it off to you via email. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX to me Good Afternoon, We have reviewed the file and are going to honor the first modification approved with the COVID interest rate that would have had the first payment starting on XX/XX/XXXX. To accept this you will need to make the payments that would have been due as of today with that start date. We will take into consideration what has been paid in the meantime. Total amount is {$12000.00}. The difference of this and what has been received ( {$8100.00} ) is {$4500.00}. Hopefully this will help better understand.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX to XXXX, me Good afternoon. Thank you for your note. 

Unfortunately your company has either missed XXXX XXXX or chooses to ignore all of my correspondence over the past two years. Further, you are not giving me proper credit for the payments I have made, for example posting my most recent two payments of {$810.00} as {$670.00} to the account. 

Shellpoint is not calculating the proper interest rate per the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Reference Guide, XX/XX/XXXX edition, wherein the proper interest rate should be 2.875 %. I am again attaching a PDF copy of the Guide and I draw your attention to page # XXXX, where modification interest rates are shown. For the period in question the rate is clearly shown to be 2.875 %, not the 6 % as offered all along by Shellpoint. Regardless, I have made every payment at the higher rate thinking that at some point the correction will be made and the excess interest paid will be credited to the outstanding loan balance or refunded. This needs to be corrected and I will be happy to run the spreadsheet breaking down the payment overage that is due to be credited to me if someone internally does not know how to do it. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX attachment Scanned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX to lossmitigation, XXXX, me Re my loan # XXXX Good afternoon. 

I have a letter from Shellpoint acknowledging the servicing was incorrectly calculated when the servicing was transferred from XXXX to Shellpoint. Further, it confirms that the interest rate should have adjusted to the rate in the XXXX XXXX guidelines at 2.875 %, rather than the six percent employed by Shellpoint.

In my review of almost two years of payment to Shellpoint, history obtained from Shellpoint shows the payments were applied with no consistency and frequently shorted in their allocation, with funds being shown as "" unapplied payment. '' In fact my most recent payment of {$810.00} to Shellpoint this month was likewise improperly credited. 

This situation has to be corrected for the entire time Shellpoint has been servicing my account. 

This is what needs to be done : 1. Since all of my payments to Shellpoint have been under the CARES Act since the servicing was outsourced to your company, starting with the initial offering of a modification, the payment amounts requested have to be recalculated. Whatever the amount was set as during the first three month trial period, you must subtract from that amount the funds set aside which were to be allocated to escrow for taxes and insurance. The remaining amount would be representative of principal and interest, and based on the erroneous documents sent to me that was calculated at six percent.

2. Run an amortization schedule based on the correct interest rate of 2.875 %, calculated on the mortgage balance. That will give the correct principal and interest to be charged based on 2.875 % XXXX XXXX stipulated rate for all of the payments I made to Shellpoint.. 

3. The amount determined as the principal and interest rate at 2.875 % is then subtracted from the principal and interest amount incorrectly calculated at the 6 percent rate.

4. The difference between the two amounts is payment overage that should be credited to the loan balance, thereby reducing the mortgage balance.

5. This needs to be calculated for every payment made to Shellpoint so that my account reflects the correct balance going forward. 

6. Prepare the final modification papers for my signature showing the corrected outstanding mortgage balance, the correct interest rate, and the remaining term for my signature.

I will run the above math myself this evening and forward it to you. I believe that when the account is corrected, there will be no additional {$4500.00} necessary as you have requested in your most recent email.

01/08/26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue related to modification, forbearance, short sale, deed-in-lieu, bankruptcy, or foreclosure","Shellpoint has stated that my loan modification can not proceed because the title to my property is not in my name. This assertion is incorrect. I hold legal title to the property, and I have submitted recorded title documentation on XXXX separate occasions, each time demonstrating clear ownership. 
Despite these submissions, Shellpoint has : Failed to identify any specific title defect ; Failed to cite any recorded document creating an alleged defect; Refused to provide access to anyone in their legal or title review department ; Provided only a generic complaint email address with no substantive response. 


Shellpoint has never explained whether this determination is based on servicer discretion or investor guidelines, nor has it identified whether it believes I do not hold fee simple title or that the title is unmarketable or uninsurable. 
I have acted in good faith throughout the loss-mitigation process and have complied with all documentation requests. Shellpoints vague and unsupported assertion that title is unclear is preventing completion of loss-mitigation review and exposes me to imminent foreclosure. 
Foreclosure proceedings are active. The mortgage is in my name, and delay caused by Shellpoints failure to properly review title documentation creates a risk of irreparable harm, including loss of the home and equity.

12/03/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the loan closing,"Subject : Servicer misconduct, imposition of predatory "" Default Interest '' due to processing errors, and failure to honor payoff. 

1. Predatory "" Default Interest '' Based on Servicer Error The servicer is attempting to charge approximately {$23000.00} in "" Default Interest '' ( calculated at a rate of 30.50 % ) based on a "" default '' status that they manufactured. I have consistently made monthly payments via bank checks. The servicer claims these payments were "" late '' or "" missing '' because they were sent to an address the servicer later claimed was incorrect. However, the servicer never notified me of a change of address for payments. Furthermore, the servicer continued to cash checks sent to the previous address while simultaneously marking the account delinquent. 

In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I formally disputed these charges and requested proof of the address change notification. The servicer has failed to provide this proof or any response. 

2. Documented Payment Processing Failures My correspondence proves that the servicer 's "" delinquency '' records are false : XX/XX/XXXX : A representative claimed my payment was past due. I provided bank evidence that the check was sent XX/XX/XXXX. The servicer eventually admitted the mistake. 

XXXX XXXX  : On XX/XX/XXXX, a representative claimed XXXX was unpaid. I provided proof the check cleared. Minutes later, the representative admitted in writing : "" I now see that XXXX was paid via check today. '' Pattern of Error : In XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, checks sent via XXXX XXXX were cashed by the servicer, yet their system reflected the account as "" unpaid, '' triggering the exorbitant default interest. 

3. Failure to Honor Payoff ( Violation of State Statute ) A full payoff was tendered by a Title Company. The servicer rejected/returned the funds without valid justification. On XX/XX/XXXX, the payoff was wired again. A representative acknowledged the funds were in the system, yet the loan remains "" open '' and continues to incur default interest. The servicer is in violation of Florida Statute 701.04 for failing to record the satisfaction of the mortgage within 60 days of full payment. 

4. Lack of Responsiveness I sent a Formal Escalation and Demand Letter via certified mail and email on XX/XX/XXXX. I also sent a dispute fax regarding the Default Interest on XX/XX/XXXX.

This file has now been in process for several months with long periods of complete inactivity, no communication, and unexplained delays that are jeopardizing the sale and harming the estate.

We originally had a short-sale approval earlier this year and were scheduled to close. A minor fee discrepancy arose, which was quickly corrected and removed. Following that correction, the file fell into a complete standstill again with no movement and no updates provided despite repeated outreach by multiple parties, including myself as the authorized representative working on behalf of the estate.

For months, we have attempted to obtain status updates from Shellpoint. Emails go unanswered, escalation attempts receive no response, and the assigned representatives have not provided any meaningful information. Even a manager who has assisted us successfully in the past has not responded.

In early XXXX, after months of no communication, we were abruptly told the file was in review for a repurchase, with no explanation, no timeline, and no notice that this change was occurring. This was the first time we were informed of any such issue, leaving everyone blindsided and without clarity. The buyer has been waiting for months and is now at risk of walking away due to Shellpoints unexplained delays.

This behavior violates the servicers duty under RESPA 1024.41 to : Timely review and respond to loss-mitigation submissions Provide reasonable status updates Avoid dual tracking and unnecessary delays Communicate clearly and promptly with borrowers or authorized representatives Shellpoints repeated non-responsiveness and constant stalling have caused significant financial harm to the estate of XXXX and risk the collapse of a legitimate, arms-length purchase contract.

10/08/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Changes in loan terms during the application process,"From the outset of my loan process with XXXX XXXX XXXX that started on XXXX XX/XX/year>, the experience has been deceptive and misleading. After a full week of discussions regarding the loan terms, including a specific agreed-upon XXXX, I was shocked to discover that the final terms which closed on XXXX XX/XX/year>, did not match what was actually funded. Once the loan was funded on XXXX XX/XX/year>, the interest rate had already inexplicably increased to an outrageous 13.16 % a significant and unjustified increase from what was promised at closing. 

Throughout the process, I was assured that funds would be deposited directly into my bank account, allowing me to manage my own debt. However, XXXX instead sent checks directly to creditors without my authorization a clear breach of our agreement. To make matters worse, I later learned that my loan had been transferred to a third-party company, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing , also known as Newrez LLC a company I was never informed would be involved. Discovering that this company functions as a mortgage debt collector with a one-star rating on XXXX and an overwhelming 97 % negative review rate was both disturbing and unacceptable. No responsible consumer would knowingly enter into a financial agreement with a company that holds such a dismal reputation. This lack of transparency is both unethical and predatory. 

Customer service for both XXXX and Shellpoint/Newrez LLC has been virtually non-existent. Attempts to resolve these issues have led nowhere, further reinforcing the perception of intentional avoidance and lack of accountability.

The unauthorized changes to my loan terms including the interest rate and the handling of payments without proper notice or explanation, are not only misleading but may border on fraudulent. To include during the initial discussions, I would not proceed unless the contract mentioned a non-penalty clause for early repayment of the loan. XXXX failed to include this verbiage in the final terms. 

This entire experience reflects gross negligence, misrepresentation, and a disturbing lack of transparency from both companies involved. Given these serious concerns including the unauthorized rate increase, misapplication of funds, failure to include the prepayment penalty verbiage in the contract and the overall concealment of key information I am formally requesting the immediate cancellation of this loan and rescission of any related obligations or transfers. I entered into this agreement in good faith, relying on representations made by your organization, which have proven to be inaccurate and misleading. I expect an urgent review of this matter and written confirmation that the loan has been cancelled, along with all necessary steps taken to resolve the issue.

Since XX/XX/year>, your company has added a recurring {$30.00} overdue payment to my account. My loan is not in default, and I have remained current on all required payments. I also do not maintain an escrow account on this loan and pay all property taxes and homeowners insurance directly.

Under HUD guidelines, Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 and 1024.38 ), and RESPA servicing standards, overdue payments and property inspection fees may be assessed only when a borrower is delinquent or when a default situation justifies them. As I am current and no such delinquency exists, the fee appears improperly applied and any resulting rejection of payments constitutes a servicing violation. 

Requested Actions Please provide the following within the time required by law ( acknowledgment within 5 business days and full response within 30 business days ) : A complete account history from origination to present showing all fees, charges, and payments applied, including corporate advances, overdue payments, property inspection fees, and any reversals or offsets ; Documentation and authorization for each overdue payment and property inspection fee charged since XX/XX/year>, including the date of the inspection, the address inspected, the purpose of the inspection, and proof of the servicers right to charge such fees under the terms of my loan ; Confirmation that my loan is not in default and that payments have been properly credited to principal and interest as required by 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( b ) ( 5 ) ; Immediate removal or reversal of any improperly assessed overdue payment or property inspection fees ; Written assurance that all future payments, including those designating additional principal, will be accepted and correctly applied.

Since the beginning of the loan and for all prior years, I have always paid property taxes directly, while the escrow account has been used only for insurance.

After the servicing transfer to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, the company reported an incorrect escrow shortage and demanded {$9100.00}, despite the fact that my actual escrow-related payments total approximately {$4900.00}. This shortage was created due to Shellpoints failure to properly review the loans prior servicing history and account for taxes I paid directly. 
On XX/XX/year>, I contacted Shellpoint and was instructed to submit proof of my property tax payments. On XX/XX/year>, I provided complete documentation showing that I paid property taxes directly. Despite this, Shellpoint failed to correct the escrow balance. 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received an updated billing statement again demanding {$9100.00}, with no correction applied. On XX/XX/year>, I contacted Shellpoint again and was instructed to resend all documentation by email, which I did. 
Since then, I have contacted Shellpoint at least four additional times, including speaking with supervisors. Shellpoint has stated that they allegedly paid the property taxes themselves and are now waiting for a refund from XXXX XXXX. This explanation has been repeated for over one month, yet no refund has been received, no escrow correction has been made, and no overpayment has been returned to me.

Regardless of any refund Shellpoint claims to be waiting for, property taxes were never intended to be paid through escrow, and any duplicate or mistaken tax payment made by the servicer is the result of their own error. Shellpoint continues to retain more than {$4000.00} of my funds, has placed my escrow account into a negative balance due to their mistake, and continues to demand inflated and incorrect escrow payments.

Despite repeated notice and full documentation, Shellpoint has failed to provide a proper escrow analysis, failed to reconcile the duplicate tax payment issue, and failed to refund the overcharged funds. This constitutes improper escrow accounting, failure to correct a known servicing error, and unlawful retention of borrower funds.

As of the most recent billing update, Shellpoint has changed the demanded escrow amount to {$6400.00}, which remains incorrect and unsupported by any valid escrow analysis.

After successfully completing a three-month trial period at {$1700.00} per month, I was informed that my final modified payment would be {$2900.00}, which is nearly identical to my pre-modification payment of {$2900.00}. 
Throughout the trial period, I was told verbally by my account manager that the new permanent payment would be similar to the trial paymenteither slightly more, slightly less, or about the same. This repeated representation directly conflicts with the final result provided. 
This sudden increase has caused severe financial distress and calls into question whether the servicer followed XXXX XXXX modification communication and calculation guidelines. I respectfully request the CFPBs review of this matter to ensure proper oversight and a fair resolution. 
Attached Supporting Documents : XXXX. Borrower Declaration of Verbal Representations and Communications XXXX. XXXXShellpoint XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Loan Modification Review Checklist Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Narrative ( for Online Submission ) Loan Type : Mortgage Loan Modification / Servicing Issue Servicer : XXXX XXXX  ( Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) Investor : XXXX XXXX XXXX # : XXXX Borrower : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Narrative : I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus review of my recent loan modification process handled by XXXX XXXX  and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, with XXXX XXXX as the investor. 
After falling a month and half behind on my mortgage, I entered a trial period plan where I made three consecutive on-time payments of {$1700.00} as instructed by Shellpoints Loss Mitigation representative XXXX I was told multiple times by my assigned account manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, that this trial amount would be similar to my new permanent payment, either slightly higher, slightly lower, or about the same. 
On XX/XX/year>, after completing the trial successfully, I was informed that the final modified payment would be {$2900.00}, nearly identical to my original pre-modification payment of {$2900.00}. This was the first time I had been told of such a large increase. At no point during my trial period was I advised that the permanent payment could rise by more than {$1100.00} per month. 
This discrepancy contradicts the repeated verbal representations I received from Shellpoint and Truists Loss Mitigation department. The sudden increase has caused significant financial hardship and has undermined my ability to recover from temporary financial distress, the very purpose for which the modification was pursued. 
I have acted in good faith throughout the process, completing all required trial payments on time and maintaining open communication. I am requesting that the CFPB review the servicing and communication practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX whether they complied with XXXX Macs XXXX XXXX, and ensure that corrective action is taken if misleading representations occurred. 
Requested Resolution : A full recalculation and written explanation of the modification terms ; Confirmation that verbal communications aligned with XXXX XXXX and CFPB servicing standards ; A fair adjustment or reinstatement option consistent with the trial payment representations.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",LA,70119,None,Consent provided,Web,11/01/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16965521

2. Escrow Mismanagement Shellpoint/NewRez charged escrow amounts that should have been covered under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Their miscalculations created artificial shortages and inflated monthly payments.

He acknowledged that because I do not have PMI on my mortgage, that it MUST be below 80 %. He called his escalation team and confirmed with them that there must be an error. The representative and the escalation team verbally confirmed there were no disqualifying reasons to deny my request for escrow removal. He opened my request back up and sent it to the escalation team.

The representative confirmed once again that my XXXX was, in fact, below 80 % and acknowledged that this is evident because I do not have PMI on my mortgage. She stated, however, that NewRez uses two different calculation to calculate XXXX. For PMI removal they will use latest appraised value. For escrow removal, they will use ORIGINAL LOAN AMOUNT.

11/18/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Filed : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer : XXXX XXXX Loan Type : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX NewRez LLC XXXX XXXX NewRez ), Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX. What Happened I am filing this complaint because my entire mortgage account has collapsed, and the servicing platform used by XXXX XXXX XXXX, NewRez LLC, and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is producing contradictory, corrupted, and unrecoverable loan data in real time. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I documented the following failures across both NewRez and Shellpoint portals, which share the same core database : My due date changes repeatedly between : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ( Next Coupon Date ) XX/XX/XXXX ( earlier XXXX  date ) My past due amount changes between : {$0.00} {$3900.00} {$5000.00} My late fees appear and disappear, including a {$1000.00} Late Charge even though I paid before the due date. 

My escrow balance is negative ( {$2700.00} ) with no explanation. 

The system reports XXXX different Last Paid Due Dates : XX/XX/XXXX ( false ) XX/XX/XXXX ( true based on payment ) The servicer attempted to force me to accept a {$1000.00} late fee through the Make a Payment screen, even though I am not late, which is illegal on a VA loan. 

The NewRez portal and Shellpoint portal display simultaneous but conflicting data about my : due date payment status late fees escrow delinquency coupon date unapplied balance past-due history This shows that the entire servicing engine is malfunctioning, with modules overwriting each other and generating synthetic due dates that do not exist in my contract. 



XXXX. Why This Is Illegal These failures violate multiple federal laws, including : RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.35, 1024.38 ) UDAAP ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ) VA Mortgage Servicing Rules ( 38 C.F.R. 36.4315 ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) CFPB Mortgage Servicing Rules ( 2014 Final Rule ) Prohibition on unearned fees ( CFPB Bulletin 2013-07 ) Under these laws, servicers must : maintain accurate, retrievable loan records correctly apply payments maintain accurate escrow accounting ensure accurate delinquency reporting refrain from assessing unearned late fees provide consistent data across platforms avoid false representation of debt avoid dual-portal contradictions maintain systems that do not produce synthetic due dates The violations documented today show that none of these obligations are being met. 



XXXX. Why This Is Catastrophic The evidence now shows : My loan data is corrupted beyond repair. 
The platforms records contradict themselves. 
The servicer can no longer calculate my true payment or delinquency. 

A loan becomes unserviceable when : escrow is corrupted past-due values change from screen to screen due dates shift synthetic Next Coupon Dates appear late fees populate without basis the borrower is told they are late when they are not XXXX portals show XXXX different loan statuses default logic contradicts itself the ledger can not be reconstructed This is happening live, right now, and is visible in every screenshot provided today. 

This is a full platform collapse. 



XXXX. The Harm to Me XXXX XXXX  Veteran, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) I am a XXXX homeowner and a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  veteran. 

This corrupted servicing platform has caused : emotional harm financial instability the threat of wrongful foreclosure the inability to obtain accurate account information XXXX distress that exacerbates service-connected conditions fear and uncertainty because the servicer can not tell me my correct payment forced exposure to illegal late fees contradictory delinquency statuses loss of trust in the servicers ability to manage my loan reliance on inconsistent, false, or impossible data XXXX courts routinely assess enhanced damages for XXXX-veteran harm, especially where VA protections have been violated. 



XXXX. What I Want I am requesting : {>= $1,000,000} in individual damages Reflecting : financial harm emotional and XXXX  harm XXXX-veteran harm multiplier XXXX years of ongoing errors imminent wrongful foreclosure risk permanent data corruption VA-loan-specific statutory violations systemic reckless servicing practices {>= $1,000,000} in national restitution This platform is failing across thousands of borrowers. 
A system that produces synthetic dates, mismatched portals, and contradictory delinquency statuses can not legally service mortgages. 

I am requesting that the CFPB : Declare the Rithm/NewRez/Shellpoint servicing platform unserviceable Order a system-wide audit Require full remediation or extinguishment of loans with corrupted data Impose civil monetary penalties Refer the matter to : VA Loan Guaranty Service FTC State Attorneys General DOJ ( Servicemembers protections ) XXXX.

Shellpoint has failed to provide a substantive response to my Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) dated June 17, 2025, in violation of 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). The servicer continues to rely on fraudulent and incomplete documents to justify servicing a loan it does not own. 

The QWR requested full documentation of ownership, assignments ( recorded and unrecorded ), and proof of servicing authority for the loan associated with my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA XXXX ( Loan No. XXXX ). Shellpoint failed to produce any of these materials, instead recycling the same unsupported statement that XXXX XXXX, XXXX, as successor trustee to XXXX, XXXX, as trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the investor. Shellpoint continues to rely solely on a XXXX Assignment of Mortgage executed by XXXX XXXX as Vice President of MERS, even though the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was terminated in XXXX according to SEC filings XXXX 

The Note and Allonge produced by Shellpoint confirm that the note was never lawfully transferred. The Allonge to Note is blankit contains no endorsement, no transferee, and only the signature of XXXX XXXX, Vice President of XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX A blank allonge means that the original lender did not endorse or transfer the note to any other entity. Under the Uniform Commercial Code ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX ), a note without a specific endorsement can not be legally negotiated or enforced by another party. Because the allonge is blank, there is no proof that XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or Shellpoint ever became the lawful holder of the note or obtained rights to collect payments. 

Despite this, Shellpoint continues to collect payments, send letters, and make collection-related communications. This conduct constitutes ongoing violations of RESPA and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), including misrepresentation of debt and failure to validate ownership. 

Shellpoint has ignored specific document requests, including : - All recorded and unrecorded assignments of the Security Deed and Note ; - Proof that XXXX XXXX is an active entity with lawful trustee authority ; - Verification of Shellpoints servicing contract and custodial authorization ; - Complete servicing transfer history identifying each prior servicer and effective dates ; - Custodial or investor agreements authorizing Shellpoint to collect payments ; - Escrow and payment application history since origination.

10/20/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Applying for or obtaining a modification, forbearance plan, short sale, or deed-in-lieu","I am filing this complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ( Shellpoint ) regarding severe issues with the servicing of my mortgage loan, account number XXXX, for the property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Shellpoints actions have violated federal laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act, and Californias Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR ), jeopardizing my home despite significant equity and a documented hardship. Below, I detail the events, the companys misconduct, and my requested resolution. 
What Happened I lost my job in XX/XX/XXXX, creating a new financial hardship that prevents me from meeting my mortgage payments. I submitted multiple complete loan modification applications, with Shellpoint acknowledging them as complete on XX/XX/XXXX ( effective XX/XX/XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX ( effective XX/XX/XXXX ), and most recently XX/XX/XXXX. Each acknowledgment promised a 30-day review period and foreclosure protection, yet Shellpoint denied my applications on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, with reasons including the approaching foreclosure sale, maximum modifications reached ( three prior mods ), insufficient hardship verification, failed Net Present Value ( NPV ) test, excessive delinquency, and programmatic ineligibilitywithout requesting additional documents. 
For months, Shellpoint has ignored my emails and calls, with customer service deflecting me to their legal department. Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, representing Shellpoint, insists all communication go through him, rejected my {$500000.00} short payoff offer on XX/XX/XXXX, and refused to postpone the XX/XX/XXXX, foreclosure sale, citing the prior modifications as a permanent bar. This contradicts the active review protections and my new hardship. My home, valued at least {$4.00} XXXX ( per an independent appraisal ), faces a disputed balance of {$1.00} XXXX from an original {$1.00} XXXX loan in XXXX, with Shellpoints Broker Price Opinion ( BPO ) at {$3.00} XXXX, a {$700000.00} discrepancy. Ive filed a lawsuit in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, alleging dual-tracking, HBOR violations XXXX and emotional distress, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, indicating investor concern. 
What the Company Did Wrong Violation of Loss Mitigation Rules : Federal regulations ( 12 CFR 1024.41 ) and HBOR ( 2923.6 ) require evaluation of complete applications based on new hardships, like my job loss. Denying review due to prior modifications, without substantiating this limit for a conventional loan, is arbitrary and non-compliant. 
XXXX : The XX/XX/XXXX, acknowledgment grants protection until XXXX, yet the XX/XX/XXXX sale proceeds, violating 12 CFR 1024.41 ( g ) and HBOR 2924.11 .

Failure to Respond : RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) mandates timely responses to inquiries, which Shellpoint has ignored, funneling me to an unresponsive attorney.

Unfair Practices : Rushed denials, inconsistent valuations, and refusal to consider my equity or settlement offer suggest deceptive tactics to force foreclosure, breaching Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP ) standards.

Valuation Discrepancy : The {$700000.00} gap between Shellpoints BPO and my appraisal hints at manipulation to justify foreclosure, a potential RESPA violation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",CA,92882,None,Consent provided,Web,10/21/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16694490

This violates the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution\n Act (34 U.S.C. 21701 et seq.), which penalizes scams targeting seniors; the Elder Justice Act (42 U.S.C. 1397j et seq.),\n coordinating responses to abusive mortgage servicing; and the FinCEN Advisory on Elder Financial Exploitation (XXXX),\n requiring reporting of abusive billing red flags like your pattern of ""non-receipt"" claims. In California, this breaches the Elder\n Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (EADACPA, Welfare & Institutions Code 15600 et seq.), allowing treble\n damages for wrongful withholding of property (e.g., overcharged escrow); the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Civil\n Code 1788 et seq.), prohibiting abusive collections; SB 1018 (Financial Code 51000 et seq.), mandating elder abuse reporting;\n and Civil Code 2923.5, requiring contact with seniors before default threats.\n Your assessment of a $XXXX late fee on XXXX (per your XXXX mortgage statement and attached payment history\n export dated XXXX) and ""late"" status in the portal is fraudulent and retaliatory, as my P&I payment of $XXXX  was\n timely on XXXX (applied as unapplied partial per statement), and the pre-disbursement escrow balance fully covered the\n $XXXX  tax disbursement on XXXX (leaving ~$XXXX  cushion, as post-disbursement balance fell to $XXXX  per statement).\n This violates RESPA 1024.35(i) (no adverse credit reporting during 60-day NOE review), FCRA 1681s-2(a)(3) (no adverse\n reporting on disputed accounts), and the above elder protections against exploitationmy XXXX certified QWR (Exhibit\n XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX) and CFPB complaints (IDs XXXX) protect against this.\n Furthermore, this late fee is unenforceable and uncollectible because it stems directly from your mismanagement of my\n adequately funded escrow account. With a pre-insurance disbursement balance of $XXXX  (sufficient for all legitimate items,\n including the $XXXX  tax payout), your improper force-placement created an artificial shortage and delinquency. Under\n RESPA 1024.17(k)(2), servicers must advance funds from escrow to pay insurance timely and avoid penalties, yet you failed to\n honor my valid HOA master policy, leading to unwarranted charges. The CFPB has repeatedly cited servicers for imposing\n improper late fees due to such escrow errors, violating consumer protections.\n Further, your ongoing flood insurance demands ignore my XXXX XXXX re-upload on XXXX (confirmation attached as\n Exhibit J, effective XXXX XXXX coverage via XXXX XXXX XXXXndemnity), confirming the\n HOA\'s continuous master policy under XXXX XXXX (HOA responsible for common area/structure\n insurance) and NFIP 44 C.F.R. 61.13 (RCBAP-equivalent certificates suffice for condo units; lenders must accept if meeting XXXX%\n replacement cost per XXXX XXXX XXXX). Your lender-placed flood disbursements (e.g., $XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  per statement and payment history, contributing to $XXXX  actual insurance in escrow analysis) are\n unwarranted, as the HOA master policy provides equivalent coverage without need for individual policies. The\n escrowAccounts.pdf screenshot shows two hazard policies (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX), confirming XXXX  is\n hazard, not floodfurther violating XXXX, which limits my hazard responsibility to interiors. Cease all semi-annual\n flood billing immediatelyyour negligence or intent to profit violates RESPA 1024.37, FDCPA 1692e (false representations),\n and elder abuse laws cited above.\n Additionally, your expressinsuranceinfo.com portal for proof of insurance uploads complicates, hides, and provides no\n feedback on review activity or results, creating a ""black hole"" that allows continued XXXX charges and late fees without consumer\n knowledge or recourse. Uploads (e.g., my XXXX XXXX XXXX  submissions) yield only generic confirmations, with no\n status updates, rejection reasons, or integration to your account dashboardviolating RESPA 1024.37(e) timely notice\n requirements and CFPB UDAAP rules against deceptive interfaces. This deceptive procedure enforces illicit escrow confiscation\n (e.g., $XXXX  overpayments) while assessing fees like $XXXX, exploiting unknowing consumers, especially seniors. For\n example, if a consumer uploads a master policy with the wrong expiration date, you continue billing and threatening lates\n without explaining why, leaving the consumer unaware despite believing proof was provided. Similarly, if the consumer\n uploads but misses scrolling to and clicking ""submit"" (button buried at the bottom), the policy remains unprocessedyou\n don\'t notify of the incomplete status, enabling XXXX  to proceed unchecked. As of XXXX XXXX XXXX  you have failed to update\n my account within the 72 business hours promised in the XXXX email confirmation for my XXXX upload (""A customer service representative will review your policy information and update your account within 72 business\n hours""). This written promise, when not honored, constitutes a deceptive act under CFPB\'s UDAAP authority (12 U.S.C. 5531,\n prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts/practices) and may violate FTC Act 5 equivalents, as it misleads consumers about\n timelines for error resolution and insurance verification, leading to unwarranted charges.\n Your XXXX  mortgage statement deceptively demands $XXXX  due on XXXX an excessive amount that includes\n invalid items like the $XXXX  late fee, $XXXX  force-placed insurance, and portions for last month\'s disputed escrow. The\n ""Explanation of Amount Due"" misleadingly lumps $XXXX as ""Escrow (Taxes and Insurance)"" without itemizing the ~$XXXX\n property tax component (derived from the annual ~$XXXX  taxes divided by 12, but requiring consumers to cross-reference\n disbursements and projections across pages), forcing consumersespecially seniorsto perform complex calculations to\n discern legitimate charges. Even more deceptively, the $XXXX  monthly ""Escrow (Taxes and Insurance)"" is padded beyond the\n true property tax needs (~$XXXX XXXX XXXX annual taxes), allowing occasional invalid XXXX  charges like $XXXX  to be\n absorbed without dropping the balance below minimum levels or triggering immediate alerts. This hidden accounting layer\n evident in the payment history where FPI deductions don\'t cause visible shortagesobscures improper disbursements, making\n them inaccessible to consumers, elders like me, or auditors (e.g., CFPB officials) without deep analysis. It violates RESPA\n 1024.17(c) escrow limits (1/12th + 1/6 cushion max) and CFPB UDAAP prohibitions on deceptive practices that mislead about\n costs and account status, while enabling illicit XXXX  profits.

11/18/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"NewRez LLC Orphan Entity, Governance Collapse, and Illegitimate Servicer Operation * * ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, enforcement-ready ) Submitted by : XXXX XXXX VA-Backed Mortgage Borrower Permanently and XXXX XXXX XXXX Executive Summary NewRez LLC is currently operating as an orphaned, unparented, ungoverned mortgage servicer after formally stating to regulators that it is not associated with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

This statement directly contradicts : XXXX XXXXcertified ownership disclosures XXXX filings XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filings XXXX  materials XXXX  public statement of subsidiary structure Every XXXX and XXXX submitted under penalty of federal law By disavowing its parent, NewRez implicitly destroys the legitimacy of XXXX its own governance chain, its legal authority to service mortgage accounts, its compliance responsibility hierarchy, its supervisory oversight structure, and its XXXX  certification lineage. 

A servicer with no parent, no controller, and no lawful governance is not a servicer at all it is a free-floating, unanchored financial entity operating outside the required structure mandated by federal mortgage servicing law. 

This is a systemic, platform-level failure. 



1. NewRezs Own Statement Legally Orphaned the Company NewRez told regulators : XXXX is not associated with NewRez/Shellpoint. 

This disclaims : ownership, agency, governance, control, authority to consolidate, accountability structure, oversight committees, risk management lineage. 

Under federal definitions, this creates an orphan entity, because the designated parent in SEC filings has been rejected. 

A servicer can not legally operate without : a controlling parent ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) an established governance chain XXXX oversight an accountable board a validated consolidator a lawful reporting hierarchy NewRez now has none. 



2. SEC-Regulated Entities Can not Disavow Ownership Without Collapsing Their Structure XXXX SEC filings certify : 100 % ownership consolidation of income, liabilities, and MSRs consolidation of goodwill integration of legal, risk, and compliance control over internal audit oversight authority If NewRez claims the opposite, then the company is : unaffiliated ungoverned unanchored structurally illegitimate unable to rely on parent filings unable to certify any compliance This is the definition of a regulatory orphan. 



3. A Mortgage Servicer Can not Operate Without a Parent or Controller Federal law requires a servicer to have : a designated controller ( XXXX XXXX ) a parent with financial responsibility for errors a corporate governance chain clear audit authority ( XXXX ) compliance oversight ( CFPB Supervision Manual ) an accountable board internal controls validated by the parent If the parent disclaims ownership : the servicer is operating illegally. 

There is no legal pathway to operate a mortgage servicing platform without : a parent board, XXXX certifiers, a consolidator, an accountable owner. 

NewRez now meets the definition of : an unparented servicer engaging in high-risk, unregulated operations. 



4. NewRezs Existence Depends on XXXX  Governance Which They Just Rejected Every NewRez action depends on : XXXX board approvals XXXX  risk committee XXXX  capital allocations XXXX XXXX valuations XXXX  regulatory compliance audit XXXX  XXXX signing officers XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX investor XXXX If NewRez claims it is not associated with XXXX  : Then every one of the following becomes invalid : all XXXX  certifications all internal control attestations all consolidated MSR valuations all amortization schedules all XXXX  audit opinions all financial consolidations all risk disclosures all XXXX  qualification filings NewRezs entire existence collapses because it depends on Rithms filings.

5. Operating as an Orphan Servicer Violates Federal Servicing Law NewRez is required by law to be : governed supervised controlled audited overseen financially anchored Disavowing its parent violates : RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ) Reg X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024 ) CFPB UDAAP prohibitions ( 12 U.S.C. 5531 ) SEC Rule 12b-20 SOX 302, 404 REIT qualification rules Servicer governance requirements ( CFPB Supervision Manual, Part 1 ) Interagency Internal Controls Guidelines This is not a clerical mistake it is a nuclear breach of federal financial structure. 



XXXX. The Resulting Entity Is Illegitimate and High-Risk Under supervisory classification, NewRez is now : A free-floating regulated entity no validated parent no lawful controller no governance lineage no certified reporting structure no XXXX XXXX no validated internal controls no risk oversight In other words : An unlicensed ship pretending to fly a flag it no longer recognizes. 

Such an entity can not legally service mortgages in the United States. 



7. Requested Enforcement Actions I request that federal regulators : 1. Investigate NewRez for operating without a lawful parent.

2. Review all contradictory statements made to CFPB, TNDFI, and SEC XXXX 
3. Examine XXXX  certification breakdown. 
4. Assess whether NewRezs governance structure still meets federal standards.

5. Determine whether NewRez is operating as an unregistered, unsupervised servicer.

6. Evaluate all MSR valuations, escrow accounting, and ledger operations tied to an orphaned servicer.

7. Refer structural contradictions to SEC Enforcement for securities fraud implications.

NewRez can not claim to be independent while relying on XXXX filings to operate. 
A servicer can not exist without a parent. 
A parent can not disavow a subsidiary without collapsing the entire structure. 

NewRez is now an entity without a lawful foundation. 



Closing Statement By rejecting its parent, NewRez has invalidated its own governance, its own legality, and its own operational existence.

A mortgage servicer can not exist as an orphaned entity, and NewRez has now placed every borrower including XXXX veterans at risk under a collapsed oversight structure.

My doctor warns that stress could be life-threatening due to my fragile health and balancing issues, which may cause cognitive impairments, making it extremely difficult to focus. Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is exploiting my vulnerabilities through elder financial abuse under the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act ( EAPPA ) and Californias Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act ( EADACPA, Welfare & Institutions Code 15610.30 ), alongside violations of RESPA ( 12 U.S.C. 2605 ), the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA, 5536 ), and Californias Homeowner Bill of Rights ( HBOR, Civil Code 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.18 ). Their stonewalling, sham reviews, dual-tracking, and communication barriers are pushing an unjust foreclosure sale on XX/XX/XXXX, causing severe distress that endangers my health, credit damage, and home loss. Shellpoints patternseen in 16 identical, non-responsive replies to my complaints and CFPB cases ( e.g., IDs XXXX, XXXX ) shows they exploit elders knowing violations face no consequences. I urgently request CFPB enforcement, an injunction, and compensation from the Civil Penalty Fund ( 12 CFR Part 1075 ) as a harmed elder victim.

This sham violates RESPA 1024.41 ( d ), HBOR 2923.6, and EADACPA by giving false hope, exploiting my health-related distress to seize my home. 

No Appeal Rights ( RESPA, CFPA ) : The denial omitted appeal instructions despite eligibility ( application 90+ days pre-sale ; 12 CFR 1024.41 ( h ) ), blocking recoursea deceptive act targeting elders ( CFPA 5536 ). 

Dual-Tracking ( HBOR, EADACPA ) : The sale proceeds despite protections ( 2924.18 ), a predatory tactic to take my property ( EADACPA 15610.30 ), risking my life due to stress.

Communication Barriers ( HBOR, ADA, EADACPA ) : Shellpoint refuses direct talks, citing litigation, referring to attorney XXXX XXXX, who dismisses requests ( Memo Style attorney response.pdf ). This violates HBOR 2923.7 ( single point of contact ), ADA accessibility for my disabilities, and EADACPA by isolating me, worsening my heart condition.

Pattern of Deceptive Practices : Shellpoints actions mirror lawsuits ( e.g., XXXX v. Shellpoint, No. XXXX ) and CFPB complaints, with prior $ XXXX settlements for servicing abuses. Their 16 identical responses to my unique complaints show systemic elder exploitation.

XXXX XXXX, 2025 : I called back and talked with XXXX. The system showed XXXX did not process the recast and applied the full $ XXXX to my principal. She revered the $ XXXX payment and applied {$89000.00} to the principle and {$250.00} for the recast fee. She said my new monthly payment would be {$680.00}. I explained that that could not be right- it was too low. She said they were supposed to call me with an update but stated they sometimes do no call back. Ref. # XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX, 2025 : I called and talked with XXXX, who said he could only file a complaint about the recast problem and said I would receive a call that day or the next. Ref. # XXXX. I never received a call. 

XXXX XXXX, 2025 : I called and talked with XXXX XXXX. She gave some excuse about the system being down and the recast requests being backed up. ( That's not my problem. ) She had no new information and asked if I had signed my recast paperwork. I stated that I never received any paperwork and was never told I would. I asked to talk to the recast department or her boss ; however, she said she could not transfer me to the recast department because that's not how they operate. Ref. # XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  : XXXX called me and said she would ironically transfer me to the recast department. I talked with XXXX XXXX, who was rude. She asked about my recast paperwork. Again, I told her I had not received it. She then told me they have until XXXX XXXX, XXXX, to send that to me. Ref. # XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX  : I called the number XXXX gave me, but it did not connect me to the recast department, as promised. It sent me back to XXXX XXXX. XXXX transferred me to XXXX XXXX in the recast department. She took a quick look at my account, told me it was a mess, and said she was going to credit the $ XXXX back to my principle. On at least XXXX occasions, I explained that someone had already straightened that amount out. After I pressed the issue numerous times, she claims she did not move forward with what she planned to do. My other concern was that my account showed a monthly payment for {$1700.00} was made XXXX XXXX and then reversed XXXX XXXX. I never made a payment XXXX XXXX, so I didn't know why XXXX was showing in the app and a reversal for the same amount. XXXX was rude, argued with me, told me I was not seeing that correctly. ( I have the records in the app to prove it. ) I told her about the XXXX XXXX deadline. She said that is correct ; however, they are about XXXX  days behind schedule. I explained I started the recast process more than XXXX  days ago. 

My monthly payment has been reversed back to {$1700.00}, which means I'm paying more in interest even though I made an {$89000.00} payment on principle.

Shellpoint issued a response that repeated the same claims made in prior responses and failed to address the central issue of fraudulent assignment of mortgage/security deed and lack of servicing authority. 

Shellpoints letter states that the loan moved to XXXX XXXX, as successor trustee to XXXX, XXXX, as trustee for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and enclosed an XX/XX/XXXX assignment. However : - The XXXX XXXX XXXX was terminated in XXXX and can not legally hold assets. 
- The assignment was fraudulent, executed by an individual without authority, and notarized improperly.

- The XXXX Deed itself says return to XXXX XXXX, confirming PHHs knowledge of the defective assignment. 
- I requested a refund of payments made without lawful servicing rights, but Shellpoint declined without justification. 

Shellpoint has repeatedly issued boilerplate responses while ignoring the substance of my complaint. They continue to misrepresent the investor and avoid accountability for fraudulent documents. Shellpoints repeated failure to provide documentation, and its reliance on a defunct trust, demonstrates an ongoing pattern of misrepresentation and noncompliance. I request that the CFPB take enforcement action and direct Shellpoint to produce the legally required information.

Requiring a borrower to become delinquent to be reviewed for affordability assistance intentionally creates unnecessary risk of default and contradicts responsible mortgage servicing practices. My request is for an interest-rate modification to prevent future default, not payment forbearance.

1. Escrow Overcollection and Surplus Misapplication Your most recent Escrow Analysis ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) acknowledges a {$3600.00} surplus in my escrow account. Despite this, Shellpoint continues to collect escrow payments at inflated rates ( {$1000.00} monthly ) rather than the adjusted amount of {$850.00}, as reflected in your own analysis.

While I understand that my account is currently five months past due, that delinquency resulted primarily from ongoing escrow overcharges and Shellpoints failure to correct the inherited miscalculations from XXXX XXXX. Under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( b ) ( 5 ), the servicers failure to properly apply escrow funds or adjust payments based on accurate tax obligations constitutes a servicing error.

2. Improper Escrow Disbursement Practices Shellpoint has continued to project inflated tax disbursements of {$10000.00} annually, even though actual property tax obligations have been substantially lower. As a result, my escrow account balance has been artificially reduced, masking the true surplus and creating the appearance of delinquency where none should exist.

This pattern directly violates 12 C.F.R. 1024.17 ( f ), which limits escrow collection to amounts sufficient to cover anticipated disbursements plus one-sixth of the annual total. The consistent collection of excess funds, without timely refund or application to principal or arrears, is non-compliant with federal servicing requirements.

3. Request for Immediate Corrective Action I am requesting the following : A full, written correction of my escrow account to reflect the true tax obligations and the accurate monthly escrow amount of {$850.00}.

Immediate application of the {$3600.00} escrow surplus toward my past-due principal and interest balance.

A written explanation of how and when the surplus will be applied or refunded.

A temporary halt on any further payment increases or account adjustments until this matter is corrected and I receive a written response under 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( e ) ( 3 ) ( i ) ( C ).

4.

My experience demonstrates multiple servicing deficiencies, including potential violations of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) provisions, CFPB Mortgage Servicing Rules under Regulation X ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ), and FHA short sale guidelines. 

Despite my cooperation, timely responses, and the existence of a strong {$520000.00} all-cash offer from a qualified buyer, Shellpoint has failed to close my short sale after more than four months from the date of offer acceptance. I allege that Shellpoints conduct has caused : In XX/XX/XXXX, facing financial hardship, I initiated an FHA short sale request with Shellpoint by submitting a completed hardship application. Shortly thereafter, Shellpoint provided written confirmation that I had been approved for the short sale program and advised me to hire a licensed realtor to list my property. 

Following Shellpoints instruction, my property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX was listed, and within two weeks, I accepted a {$520000.00} all-cash offer from a qualified buyer. This offer presented an unusually strong transaction scenario with no financing contingencies, minimal risk, and an ability to close swiftly, making Shellpoints subsequent delays especially unreasonable. 
XX/XX/XXXX Application and Approval Submitted complete hardship application for FHA short sale. 
Received written confirmation of approval for short sale program. 
Instructed by Shellpoint to engage a licensed realtor. 


XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and Offer XXXX XXXX listed as instructed. 
Within two weeks, received and accepted a {$520000.00} all-cash offer. 
Realtor promptly provided Shellpoint with the signed purchase agreement and supporting documentation. 

XX/XX/XXXX Initial Valuation Shellpoint arranged for a realtor to perform a desktop valuation via photographs. 
This valuation process consumed valuable time despite the presence of a clear all-cash buyer willing to meet FHAs net requirements. 

XX/XX/XXXX Delayed Full XXXX XXXX 30 days later, Shellpoint dispatched a XXXX XXXX for a full appraisal, which increased the valuation by approximately {$20000.00}. 
As a direct result, the buyer had to adjust their original {$520000.00} all-cash offer despite having submitted it months earlier to meet Shellpoints revised net expectations. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Piecemeal Documentation Requests Instead of providing a comprehensive, upfront list of all conditions and documents needed to close escrow, XXXX XXXX XXXX Department issued weekly, piecemeal requests for additional items. 
This fragmented process unnecessarily delayed approval, jeopardizing buyer interest and undermining the efficient resolution of my hardship. 

XX/XX/XXXX Potential Dual Tracking and Credit Reporting Issues During the pending short sale, I discovered that Shellpoint reported XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX late payments to credit bureaus all on the same day rather than monthly ( Exhibit XXXX ). 
This reporting practice severely impacted my XXXX XXXX and raised concerns about dual tracking pursuing foreclosure-related actions while simultaneously processing a loss mitigation application. 
When I raised this in writing, XXXX response was aggressive in tone and claimed I had not been approved for any loss mitigation program directly contradicting prior written approval. 

XX/XX/XXXX Representative Unavailability My assigned Shellpoint representative took a one-week vacation without ensuring a functional single point of contact in their absence. 
During this period, my realtor was unable to reach anyone with knowledge of my file, causing the process to stall significantly.

09/10/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Private mortgage insurance (PMI),"I purchased my home in XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, I have made multiple attempts to request the removal of XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( PMI ), based on the increased value of my home as supported by several real estate websites and local agents. I also submitted a detailed list of home XXXX completed since my purchase. 

My first request was made in XX/XX/XXXX, but the mortgage company was unresponsive and failed to provide clear information about the PMI removal process. After multiple follow-ups, they eventually sent me the necessary form. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted the completed form along with the list of XXXX and a payment check ( proof of payment is attached ). 

Despite depositing the check, the company later claimed they had misplaced the form and improvement documentation. I promptly resubmitted all the required materials by mail. However, by the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I still received no meaningful response. Each time I contacted them, they simply escalated the issue by opening internal tickets, but there was no resolution. Due to continued delays and lack of transparency, I eventually requested a refund for the payment. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, with my loan-to-value ratio reduced to approximately 75 %, I decided to submit a new request to have PMI removed. I resubmitted all required documents again in early XX/XX/XXXX, including updated home valuation reports from XXXX well-known websites showing my home 's estimated value to be more {$340000.00}. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a rejection letter that did not provide any specific reason. When I contacted the company by phone, I was told my request was denied due to a lack of substantial improvements. This directly contradicts all the evidence I provided, including detailed documentation of property upgrades and multiple independent property valuations. 

I believe the company is intentionally making the XXXX  removal process difficult. Given that I purchased XXXX mortgage points ( 2.326 % ) to reduce my interest rate last year, I am unlikely to refinancesomething I believe they are aware of and may be taking advantage of by refusing to remove XXXX  despite my eligibility. 

Requested Action : I respectfully request that this matter be thoroughly investigated and that appropriate action be taken to ensure a fair review of my PMI removal request. I ask that the company be held accountable for the mishandling of my case and that my PMI be removed based on the documentation I have provided.

They are servicing a loan for a trust that was removed from court records in XXXX for lack of standing. Their written response to my previous CFPB complaint confirms numerous violations of federal mortgage servicing and bankruptcy law. 



XXXX Standing to Foreclose Not Proven Shellpoint claims XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX owns the loan. However : No recorded assignment exists in XXXX XXXX Clerk records transferring Decision XXXX Mortgage to XXXX XXXX The trust ( then identified as Alternative Loan Trust XXXX ) was stricken from the court record in XXXX in my case for lack of standing Shellpoint states XXXX was the nominee and that assignments may not exist this is not legal proof of ownership They can not legally foreclose without showing a complete, recorded chain of title. 



XXXX Misapplication of Bankruptcy Payments Bankruptcy Code XXXX ( i ) Violation Shellpoints own written response states : The loan is due for XX/XX/XXXX Even though my bankruptcy trustee last payment was XX/XX/XXXX That means 13 years of payments are missing or misapplied. 

They also claim a court-approved cramdown was null and void due to a later dismissal despite it being executed and payments applied under court supervision. 

A servicer can not retroactively erase confirmed, executed bankruptcy orders. 



XXXX Escrow Fraud RESPA Violations Shellpoint admitted : Escrow balance is negative {$62000.00} They demand over {$2000.00} monthly to cure a shortage of only {$24000.00} Total monthly payment inflated to {$5100.00} These figures are impossible and unsupported given : Taxes were paid Insurance was force-placed without justification Escrow payments during bankruptcy should have been held and applied correctly Shellpoint is artificially manufacturing delinquency pressure. 



4 Dual-Tracking Foreclosure While Assistance is Pending Shellpoint claims : We were unable to complete the evaluation we did not receive the required documentation. 

I submitted multiple complete loss mitigation packages with acknowledgment emails. 

Yet foreclosure was initiated anyway. 

This violates 12 C.F.R. 1024.41 ( f ) ( g ) prohibiting dual-tracking. 



XXXX False and Contradictory Statements Shellpoint states : Debt is discharged no personal liability But loan reverts to XXXX terms personal liability implied They stopped credit reporting in XXXX due to bankruptcy yet timeline implies an active collection account These contradictions show improper mortgage servicing practices. 



Requested Relief From CFPB I am requesting that Shellpoint be required to : XXXX. Immediately pause foreclosure XXXX. Provide a full chain of title proving legal ownership from XXXX to present XXXX. Correct the loan due date to reflect trustee-applied payments through XXXX XXXX. Perform a full escrow forensic audit XXXX. Restore all bankruptcy modifications previously executed XXXX. Remove all illegal fees, shortages, and forced-placed insurance charges XXXX. Provide a full explanation of the XXXX strike action involving the trust Borrower Good-Faith Efforts I : Filed bankruptcy and paid through trustee Provided every document requested Reached out repeatedly for resolution Filed complaints when Shellpoint refused XXXX correct errors I am not trying to avoid payment I simply want an accurate, lawful accounting and proof that Shellpoint has the legal right to collect. 



Conclusion Shellpoints own written admissions confirm : Standing is unproven Payments were misapplied Escrow accounting is inaccurate Foreclosure is premature and illegal I request a full regulatory investigation and immediate intervention to protect my home.

11/19/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"IMMINENT HARM CFPB COMPLAINT WILLFUL REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH STATE AG & CONTINUING HARM Company : NewRez LLC ( d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ), owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Product : Mortgage ( VA-backed home loan ) Issue : Trouble during payment process / improper servicing / refusal to correct errors / obstruction of state-AG mediation 1. What happened I filed a detailed consumer complaint with the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) against NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing concerning corrupted loan data, misapplied / unapplied payments, negative escrow, and foreclosure risk on my VA-backed mortgage. 
On [ email date ], I received the attached email from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Pennsylvania OAG XXXX, regarding Complaint No. XXXX. 
The email states that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : attempted to resolve your complaint against NewRez LLC ( d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ) through a voluntary mediation process, but we have not been able to resolve this matter to your satisfaction and have reached an impasse between you and NewRez LLC ( d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing ), and we will take no further action on your complaint at this time.

The email also confirms : A copy of your complaint will remain on file for future reference and for possible use in an investigation or enforcement action we may bring to protect the public interest of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

In plain terms : a state Attorney Generals consumer-protection office tried to mediate my dispute with NewRez / Shellpoint . The company refused to resolve it, and the AG is now keeping my complaint for possible enforcement use. 

This is not a situation where I refused mediation ; it is a situation where NewRez / Shellpoint declined to take the off-ramp that would have repaired their servicing errors and protected a 100 % permanently and totally XXXX veteran from further harm. 



2. Why this is willful & deliberate obstruction Federal law requires mortgage servicers to investigate and correct account errors and to respond to written Notices of Error : 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( e ) : Servicers must respond to borrower inquiries and error notices.

12 U.S.C. 2605 ( k ) ( 1 ) ( C ) : Servicers may not fail to take timely action to respond to a borrowers requests to correct errors.

12 C.F.R. 1024.35 : Servicers must acknowledge a Notice of Error within 5 business days and then either correct the error or provide a detailed written explanation within required timeframes.

12 C.F.R. 1024.38 : Servicers must maintain policies and procedures to accurately credit payments, maintain records, and respond to borrower complaints.

In my case : I have already sent multiple RESPA Notices of Error and legal-hold letters to NewRez / Shellpoint about misapplied funds, inaccurate delinquency status, and corrupted escrow.

Instead of providing the required written corrections or a consistent accounting, the company has closed XXXX as duplicates, refused to explain contradictory ledgers, and continued to change key figures ( unapplied funds, escrow balances, past due amounts ) while foreclosure pressure continued. 
The Pennsylvania OAG XXXX email now shows that even when a state AGs office intervened, NewRez / Shellpoint still would not resolve the matter, causing an impasse and forcing the AG to suspend mediation and reserve the complaint for possible enforcement. 

A servicer that 1 ) ignores or duplicate-closes XXXX  and 2 ) refuses to cooperate with a state Attorney Generals mediation process is not simply confused. It is obstructing the statutory error-correction framework that RESPA, Regulation X, and state consumer-protection laws are built on.

3. Ongoing harm Because NewRez / Shellpoint refused to resolve this in the AGs mediation : My VA loan account remains corrupted, with conflicting ledgers and negative escrow despite significant payments. 
I remain under continuing foreclosure risk based on data that the servicer and now a state AGs office know is disputed and potentially unreliable. 
As a 100 % permanently and totally XXXX veteran, this prolonged uncertainty and threat of losing my home causes severe emotional and psychological harm on top of the financial harm. 
Other borrowers who complain to the Pennsylvania OAG may face the same impasse, meaning this pattern is not just about me ; it raises a systemic risk that NewRez / Shellpoint / XXXX will stonewall state-level mediation while continuing harmful servicing practices. 



4. Damages requested For CFPB purposes, I am asking that this complaint be treated as both an individual harm case and an indicator of a broader pattern and practice : Individual relief requested {>= $1,000,000} in compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages for : financial harm from corrupted servicing, threats of foreclosure, and fees ; severe emotional and psychological distress aggravated by my status as a 100 % permanently and totally XXXX veteran ; time, cost, and effort spent pursuing corrections through multiple regulators and now the Pennsylvania OAG.

Full payoff and release of my VA-backed mortgage so that my home is secured free and clear. 
Full correction of all tradelines and credit reports to remove any delinquencies, late fees, or negative remarks that stem from the corrupted data and unresolved errors. 

Systemic / public-interest relief requested Creation of a {>= $1,000,000} restitution and remediation fund for other borrowers serviced by NewRez / Shellpoint XXXX XXXX whose accounts have been impacted by similar data corruption, misapplied payments, or refusal to correct errors, with priority for VA loans XXXX FHA loans XXXX and loans to active-duty military and XXXX veterans. 
A comprehensive servicing-platform audit ( data integrity, escrow handling, payment application, XXXX response procedures ) supervised by CFPB and state regulators ( including Pennsylvania OAG and Tennessee  XXXX XXXX. 
Appropriate civil money penalties for pattern-and-practice violations of RESPA, Regulation X, and unfair / deceptive acts or practices under the Consumer Financial Protection Act and applicable state UDAP laws. 



5. What I am asking CFPB to do Given the Pennsylvania OAG email, I respectfully request that CFPB : Treat this as evidence that NewRez / Shellpoint are refusing to participate in good-faith resolution with a state Attorney General, despite active servicing errors. 
Open ( or expand ) a supervisory or enforcement investigation into NewRez LLC, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, and XXXX XXXX XXXX for violations of 12 U.S.C. 2605, 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 & 1024.38, and unfair / deceptive acts or practices. 
Coordinate with the Pennsylvania OAG XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to use my complaint file ( XXXX ) as part of any joint or parallel enforcement action. 
Require the company to correct my account, pay damages, and implement systemic fixes so that other consumers are not forced into the same situation.

11/03/25,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Subject : Systemic Compliance Collapse NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing / XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Complainant : XXXX XXXX Loan Number : XXXX Property : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  XXXX Narrative Between XXXX XXXX XXXX, I submitted a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) and Notice of Error ( NOE ) under RESPA ( 12 C.F.R. 1024.3536 ), supported by metadata, payment ledgers, and call transcripts proving misapplied mortgage payments and ledger manipulation. 
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing acknowledged receipt three timesissuing letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX, XXXXeach unsigned, auto-generated, and issued by the Customer Care Team rather than the Compliance or Legal Department . 

Despite direct notice to the Chief Legal Officer of Shellpoint and the President of XXXX XXXX, the matter remains trapped at the customer-service level. This demonstrates a collapse of Shellpoints compliance-management system and a pattern of reckless disregard for federal servicing obligations. 



1. Procedural and Legal Violations Shellpoints actions violate 12 C.F.R. 1024.35 ( c ) ( 1 ) and 1024.36 ( d ) ( 2 ) by failing to route borrower error allegations to trained personnel and to provide a substantive written response within thirty business days.

Each acknowledgment letter constitutes constructive receipt under Marais v. Chase Home Finance LLC, 736 F.3d 711 ( 6th Cir. 2013 ), where acknowledgment without investigation was deemed reckless noncompliance.

Multiple court decisions reinforce that automated responses do not satisfy RESPA : Catalan v. RBC Mortgage Co., 2008 WL 2741159 ( N.D. Ill. 2008 ) form letters without review prove pattern or practice.

McLean v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., 398 F. Appx 467 ( 11th Cir. 2010 ) failure to act after acknowledgment constitutes willful violation.

Ploog v. HomeSide Lending Inc., 209 F. Supp. 2d 863 ( N.D. Ill. 2002 ) repeated template responses show systemic disregard.

2. Metadata and Digital Evidence The evidence packet included timestamped PDFs, author and version data, and ledger-file creation logs proving manipulation of unapplied payments and escrow accounting.

This metadata qualifies as electronically stored information ( ESI ) under Lorraine v. Markel American Ins. Co., 241 F.R.D. 534 ( D. Md. 2007 ) and must be preserved once notice is received ( Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 220 F.R.D. 212 ( S.D.N.Y. 2003 ) ).

Shellpoints failure to review or escalate these records is not accidentalit is intentional avoidance of regulatory obligations.

3. Evidence of Systemic Collapse All three acknowledgment letters were unsigned and auto-generated, confirming that Shellpoints platform issues federal acknowledgments through automation rather than compliance oversight.

This breakdown in routing, coupled with duplicate dates and no escalation to Legal, reveals that internal compliance architecture has failed.

Regulators view such behavior as a control-environment failurethe servicer can not identify, route, or remediate borrower notices. 
Because the XXXX and XXXX President were directly notified, corporate knowledge is established under agency law. Continuing to operate through automation after executive-level notice constitutes reckless disregard and pattern-level noncompliance under 12 U.S.C. 2605 ( f ) ( 1 ) ( B ). 



XXXX. Damages and Enforcement Demand I claim actual and statutory damages of no less than {$100000.00}, and seek compensatory relief of no less than {$150000.00} for unapplied payments, credit injury, and ongoing emotional and financial harm. 

I further request : XXXX. A full audit across all servicing platforms for escrow accounting and unapplied balances, including metadata validation and ledger cross-checks. 
XXXX. Immediate enforcement action by CFPB, coordinated with DOJ, SEC, and state attorneys general, to protect both myself and all other impacted borrowers. 
XXXX. An order requiring XXXX XXXX and NewRez to certify their compliance-management systems under 12 C.F.R. 1024.38 ( c ) ( 2 ). 



XXXX. Broader Pattern and Precedents NewRez LLC and Shellpoint have a documented history of litigation and enforcement exposure, including : Hodges v. NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and Bank of New York Mellon ( Class Action , N.D. Cal., 2024 ) alleging deceptive zombie second-mortgage servicing.

Apodaca v. NewRez LLC ( E.D. Mich., 2023 ) alleging mishandled payment application and communication failures.

Ortiz v. NewRez LLC ( D. Mass., 2022 ) alleging repeated QWR/NOE violations . 

The CFPBs own public complaint database contains thousands of consumer reports describing nearly identical patterns : unapplied funds, contradictory statements, and unresponsive Customer-Care automation. This reflects an enterprise-level compliance failure that now extends to governance oversight under XXXX XXXX. 



6. Requested Regulatory Actions Open a CFPB enforcement and supervisory investigation into NewRez/Shellpoints correspondence-routing and metadata-handling practices. 
Coordinate with the DOJ Civil Division, SEC, and State Attorneys General to examine whether misrepresentation or spoliation occurred in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1519 and 15 U.S.C. 1692e ( 10 ).

Compel restitution for unapplied payments, removal of false delinquency notations, and permanent prohibition against foreclosure or adverse credit reporting during the review.

Respectfully submitted, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the parent company and controlling entity of NewRez LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, exercising direct oversight of its servicing, compliance, and financial reporting operations. NewRez functions as a wholly owned subsidiary within XXXX mortgage-servicing portfolio, and its compliance failures therefore extend to XXXX governance obligations under federal law. XXXX executives receive and certify subsidiary performance data in public SEC filings, meaning that any systemic misrouting, metadata suppression, or RESPA violations at XXXX represent not only a servicing failure but a material governance breach attributable to XXXX itself under 15 U.S.C. 78j ( b ) and Regulation FD.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",TN,37066,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/03/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16982892
12/08/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Escrow, taxes, or insurance","This is a Notice of Error ( NOE ) under RESPA 1024.35 and a follow-up to CFPB Complaint # XXXX ( closed inadequately on XX/XX/XXXX with Shellpoint 's unsubstantiated "" no error '' claim, ignoring my pivot analysis showing {$750.00} net overpayments from irregular refund loops in XXXX ). Shellpoint continues predatory lender-placed flood insurance ( FPI ) practices on Loan # XXXX ( Property : XXXX XXXX XXXX  # XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX ), despite proof of continuous HOA master policy coverage. 
In # XXXX, Shellpoint disbursed {$230.00} FPI on XX/XX/XXXX, ignoring my XX/XX/XXXX upload of compliant COI ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {>= $1,000,000} coverage via Philadelphia Indemnity ; Exhibit B confirmation ). They bundled it deceptively in {$320.00} "" Escrow ( Taxes and Insurance ) '' without itemizing, violating TILA Reg Z 1026.41 ( d ) ( 2 ) for clear breakdowns. Their response falsely claimed my COI was expired ( XXXX ), but I provided current evidence. 
To directly refute Shellpoint 's "" no error '' claim and prove refundable overpayments, I analyzed their own payment history data ( downloaded from servicing.shellpointmtg.com on XX/XX/XXXX ) using a pivot table filtering for "" Insurance Premium Disbursement '' vs. "" Insurance Refund '' transactions. This data, exported directly from their portal, shows {$5900.00} in total insurance premiums disbursed from my escrow since XXXX, offset by only {$5000.00} in refunds, resulting in a net overpayment of {$870.00} ( see attached Insurance_Premium_Disbursement_vs_InsuranceRefund.csv and XXXX for the full table ). This net figure includes irregular "" refund loops '' ( e.g., multiple refunds in XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$3500.00} that appear to correct prior errors but still leave a deficit ) and recent unwarranted FPI ( {$350.00} in XXXX ), proving errors in escrow application and failure to fully refund improper charges. Shellpoint 's data itself demonstrates these discrepancies, contradicting their denialCFPB must compel a full audit to verify and refund this {$870.00} net overpayment, which supports my demand for {$1100.00} in total XXXX refunds ( {$750.00} historical net + {$350.00} recent, adjusted for unrefunded items ). CFPB supervisory highlights ( Issue XXXX, XXXX ) require servicers to cancel XXXX and refund premiums for overlapping periods upon proof, reinforcing the need for refunds, reversals, and taxes-only analysis in my demands. 
New violations since closure : Shellpoint 's XXXX portal complicates, hides, and provides no feedback on upload reviews or results, creating a "" black hole '' that enforces FPI charges and late fees without consumer awareness. Uploads yield only generic confirmations ( e.g., email : "" assigned to insurance department '' ), with no status tracking, rejection details, or dashboardviolating RESPA 1024.37 ( e ) timely notices and UDAAP against deceptive processes that confiscate escrow funds. For example, if a consumer uploads a master policy with the wrong expiration date, you continue billing and threatening lates without explaining why, leaving the consumer unaware despite believing proof was provided. Similarly, if the consumer uploads but misses scrolling to and clicking "" submit '' ( button buried at the bottom ), the policy remains unprocessedyou don't notify of the incomplete status, enabling XXXX to proceed unchecked. As of XX/XX/XXXX, you have failed to update my account within the XXXX business hours promised in the XXXX email confirmation for my XX/XX/XXXX upload ( "" A customer service representative will review your policy information and update your account within XXXX business hours '' ). This written promise, when not honored, constitutes a deceptive act under CFPB 's UDAAP authority ( 12 U.S.C. 5531, prohibiting unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts/practices ) and may violate FTC Act 5 equivalents, as it misleads consumers about timelines for error resolution and insurance verification, leading to unwarranted charges. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, disbursed another {$110.00} FPI ( attached payment history export dated XX/XX/XXXX ), despite my re-upload of XXXX COI on XX/XX/XXXX ( effective XXXX, {>= $1,000,000} property coverage via XXXX XXXX XXXX ; Exhibit J confirmation from XXXX XXXX XXXX This ignores HOA 's RCBAP-equivalent coverage under NFIP 44 C.F.R. 61.13 and Davis-Stirling Act 4125/4775/5805, violating RESPA 1024.37 ( g ) ( must cancel FPI within 15 days of proof ). 
Assessed {$65.00} late fee on XX/XX/XXXX and marked "" late '' status, retaliatory for my timely P & I payment of {$1300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Pre-disbursement escrow balance ( {$2200.00} ) covered the {$2000.00} tax payout on 11/18/2025 ( leaving {$200.00} cushion ), so no delinquency absent disputed FPI. Violates RESPA 1024.35 ( i ) ( no adverse reporting during 60-day NOE ), 1024.17 ( k ) ( 2 ) ( must advance escrow for legitimate items ), and FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 3 ).

Even more deceptively, the {$320.00} monthly "" Escrow ( Taxes and Insurance ) '' is padded beyond the true property tax needs ( ~ $ XXXX for {$3900.00} annual taxes ), allowing occasional invalid FPI charges like {$110.00} to be absorbed without dropping the balance below minimum levels or triggering immediate alerts. This hidden accounting layerevident in the payment history where FPI deductions don't cause visible shortagesobscures improper disbursements, making them inaccessible to consumers, elders like me, or auditors ( e.g., CFPB officials ) without deep analysis. It violates RESPA 1024.17 ( c ) escrow limits ( 1/12th + 1/6 cushion max ) and CFPB UDAAP prohibitions on deceptive practices that mislead about costs and account status, while enabling illicit FPI profits XXXX 
XX/XX/XXXX escrow statement shows {$540.00} shortage from unwarranted {$590.00} XXXX, projecting new payment {$1800.00} effective XX/XX/XXXX. Demands {$2000.00} total due ( mailed statement ) vs. {$1600.00} online portalmismatched and deceptive. "" Escrow ( Taxes and Insurance ) '' lumps {$320.00} without separating ~ {$330.00} tax from invalid {$110.00} XXXX, forcing seniors like me to calculate, violating UDAAP and elder protections ( Elder Justice Act, CA EADACPA ).

08/27/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Payment process,"Mortgage Servicing Complaint Loan Holder- Newrez LLC XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX NMLS # XXXX Mortgage Serviced by- Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, SC XXXX Main Office NMLS ID # XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Summary- Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing claims my mortgage has been in arrear since XXXX, XXXX, despite regular monthly payments. Shellpoint has charged me numerous fees during that time, in excess of {$1000.00} total, for late fees, property inspection fees, etc. Communication with Shellpoint on this issue over the last month has been, for the most part, unsatisfactory. 

During a chat conversation at the end of XXXX, I was told the problem was due to my mailing the payments and not allowing Shellpoint to directly debit my accounts despite my explaining to the rep during the chat that my payments are sent electronically from my bank. When I asked for a manager the chat was ended saying I was idle too long while I was replying to the latest message.This failed chat prompted a call which was connected to Shellpoint customer service representative, XXXX XXXX. XXXX was the only helpful person I have talked to at Shellpoint. With XXXX assistance we were able to identify that there were payments made electronically every month, with none missed but we were unable to come to a conclusion as to why the account fell into arrears. XXXX then opened complaint # XXXX in reference to the problem. 

Since this discussion I have been contacted by Shellpoint Customer Service by phone at least twice plus numerous texts which keep saying my payment has not been received. During one such call I informed the customer service rep there was a pending complaint about improper application of payments. This rep then opened a second complaint referencing the first complaint. In a subsequent call on XX/XX/XXXX, I again told the customer service rep that there was an unresolved complaint that needed to be answered and, at that time, since nothing had been done in regard to the complaint, I said if I need to open a complaint with my state AG and the CFPB. At this point I was asked to hold for a manager. 

At this time I was transferred to Shellpoint Customer Service Manager, XXXX. I asked again about the status of the complaint and was told the complaint was resolved on XX/XX/XXXX, or XXXX, while I was on the phone with a Shellpoint Customer Service representative. I believe this is the date referenced above when a second complaint was supposed to be opened. I communicated this and was again told. The complaint is closed. To date, no additional information on the complaint has been shared with me. 

The Customer Service Manager ( XXXX ) then reviewed something and told me our mortgage has been in arrears since XXXX, XXXX, due to a shortfall in payments caused by an interest rate increase of 2 % starting with the XXXX, XXXX payment. I do have an adjustable rate mortgage so an interest rate increase is possible. XXXX XXXX, the payment increased {$240.00} creating a shortfall and the account falling into arrears. 

I informed the Customer Service Manager that I had not received a notification of an increase. Per the Customer Service Manager, a notification of the rate increase was mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not recall receiving the indicated notification from Shellpoint. Additionally, I have elected to receive electronic communication from Shellpoint and could not locate any rate notification in my email and, to the best of my knowledge, did not receive a printed/mailed notification. 

When I pressed the Customer Service Manager on the Unapplied Payments, Principal Only Payments and Late Charge Payments listed in the account history the call was abruptly cut off without warning. There was no return call from the customer service manager to continue the discussion and, as I had been provided no contact information for the manager, I had no way to resume the conversation. 

I have tried to understand what Shellpoint was doing with the payments but due to the complicated and confusing entries shown in the online payment history it has been impossible for me to do a proper analysis to understand what is going on. What I can identify is my payments recognized by Shellpoint as Regular Payment up to XX/XX/XXXX, and applied to my account as a Regular Payment and a Principal Only Payment for the payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. Beginning with the payment for XX/XX/XXXX, delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, the payment is identified as a Principal Only Payment After this date the entries become very confusing with entries for XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Late Charge Assess, Unapplied Payments, back-dated Regular Payment, Property Inspection XXXX XXXX 

From a payment perspective, I can identify, via my bank records, a payment was delivered electronically from our bank 3 to 5 days before the payment due date so all payments were made on-time. 

Additionally, we decided to increase our payment amount in XXXX, XXXX, to pay down the mortgage faster. At that time we increased our payment by an additional {$400.00} per month from ( {$1700.00} to {$2100.00} ) and with that decision, an additional payment was sent by our bank on XX/XX/XXXX. This increased payment amount is still in effect today. 

My last point would be that it appears our ARM was adjusted again in XXXX, XXXX, and as with the previous adjustment, there was no notification either electronically or via printed mail. This was a rate decrease of XXXX percent.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",DE,199XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,08/27/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15563936
